1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,719
Tony Fast (he/they):
Well, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,730
Today we're going to get
started with our, how to build

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,780
inclusive data experiences event.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,590
Our featured today is Frank

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,260
Elavsky.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,600
 we'll have

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,400
him
go on and about a half an

8
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,380
hour or so in the short
term we wanted to just kind

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,790
Tony Fast (he/they): of set
the stage for the event.

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,930
Isabela, if you can go to the

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,415
next slide.

12
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:27,870
One of the oh, I see

13
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,530
what happens.

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,880
I get the delay.

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,300
All right.

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,020
Okay.

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,640
So since we are doing and building an
inclusive, talking about an inclusive

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,330
event, first thing y'all need to be
aware of is there is a code of conduct.

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,260
This is a Project Jupyter event,
which means that we're abiding the

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,550
Project Jupyter code of conduct.

21
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,040
If you have any questions
or anything that you need

22
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,835
to report.

23
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:48,629
you can

24
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:49,080
click on this

25
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,000
link and follow any

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,760
instructions. if
you need to contact any of the event,

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,499
organizers Isabela,

28
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:57,989
myself
and Tania are all here to

29
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:58,664
support you.

30
00:00:58,664 --> 00:00:59,339
so please

31
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:01,650
use the chat and
let us know if anything, if there's

32
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,630
anything you need. be reminded,
this event is recorded and posted

33
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,014
publicly.

34
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:09,399
so

35
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:11,429
between
discussions and chats and stuff

36
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:12,900
like that, all of this is public.

37
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:14,759
So, you know, be mindful,

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,280
, and yeah, that's

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,610
all the
business kind of stuff that we need.

40
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,930
So what happens next in this?

41
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,580
I think we talk, we're going to Jupyter.

42
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:26,520
Oh my God.

43
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,139
Everybody is a jovyan.

44
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,169
Yes, you are new people.

45
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:31,560
There's

46
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,850
new life.

47
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,720
But yeah, so this event is

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,560
sponsored by Project

49
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,020
Jupyter which is

50
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,800
an all in one
data science data analysis solution.

51
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,729
And we do a lot of data

52
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,370
visualization You're going

53
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,260
to hear a
lot of terms during the course of

54
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,620
this event that probably

55
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,820
Tony Fast (he/they):
revolve around Jupyter.

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,210
You'll hear about Jupyter notebooks.

57
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,360
You'll hear about JupyterHub.

58
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
You'll hear about JupyterLab.

59
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,600
If you're unfamiliar with Jupyter,
please ask questions in the

60
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,490
chat while this is going on.

61
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,540
I think it would be good to take a little
poll about how familiar folks are with

62
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,430
Jupyter so we can kind of get a feel

63
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,903
for that.

64
00:02:09,903 --> 00:02:10,640
, and,

65
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,009
yeah.

66
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,240
Welcome to possibly your
first Jupyter event or your

67
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,450
10th hundredth Jupyter event.

68
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,230
But we're happy to have you here.

69
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,280
I want to go next.

70
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:23,954
Parts of this slide.

71
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:24,404
Didn't love.

72
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:26,894
I've never gotten that before.

73
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:27,704
Perfect.

74
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:28,755
Yeah.

75
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,084
Right.

76
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,024
So Jupyter is more than a single

77
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,815
project file type

78
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:35,445
Tony Fast (he/they): interface.

79
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:37,755
It probably is the community at its

80
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:39,255
extent, but Jupyter

81
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:40,545
Tony Fast (he/they): has
a lot of things going on.

82
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:45,825
There are a lot of tools that enable data,
ingest data, visualization, data analysis.

83
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:49,755
So this talk that we're having today
is really important and recording.

84
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:52,065
It will be super valuable to the community

85
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:53,005
at large.

86
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:53,894
so again,

87
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:55,855
Tony Fast (he/they): if anybody
is not familiar with Jupyter,

88
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,894
please let's use the chat.

89
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,774
We've got a bunch of Jupyter experts
here that can help answer your

90
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:00,344
questions.

91
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:01,484
We're kind

92
00:03:01,484 --> 00:03:02,924
Tony Fast (he/they): of going
to have an intersection of

93
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:06,734
Jupyter experts and accessibility
experts and design experts here.

94
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:09,344
So let's try and make
the best of all of these

95
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,400
different people meeting.

96
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:12,770
I think

97
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,530
my only job
was to talk about Jupyter, but

98
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,790
it's really important to recognize
that Jupyter does have tons of data

99
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,290
visualization libraries, and it will
be fabulous for us in this room.

100
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,300
And those that hear this talk to figure
out how to apply Frank's principles

101
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:33,020
and the things that he talks about to
our open source tools so that we are

102
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,390
building a more inclusive experience.

103
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,250
Why don't we keep on cruising?

104
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,000
And I think it's

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,520
time for Isabela

106
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,670
to tell us
a little bit about accessibility.

107
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,560
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
Yes, it is.

108
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,640
And real quick.

109
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,120
Hello.

110
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,710
I am Isabela Presedo-Floyd.

111
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,380
I am a Latina woman with short
curly black hair, and I'm just

112
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,920
wearing a cool black and white
blazer today who you heard talking

113
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,315
was Tony.

114
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:00,710
and that

115
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,050
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): is, I
don't know how Tony wants to describe

116
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,630
himself, but he's my partner

117
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,269
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
in crime in Jupyter.

118
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:12,825
So I'm just going to be giving an overview
because I don't know exactly what Frank

119
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:17,235
has to give to us today in terms of like
explaining accessibility or anything

120
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,715
else, but just making sure we're all
kind of starting on an even foundation,

121
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:22,365
whether you decided to join this event.

122
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:24,405
Cause you're like, wow, accessibility.

123
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:27,375
I already do a ton of that and I
want to learn more. Or whether you're

124
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,025
like, oh, I've never heard of this.

125
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,975
I'm just really curious about what it is.

126
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:36,675
So accessibility is we're going
to be using it today is a term to

127
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:40,455
describe designing building and
just creating things that can be

128
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:42,435
used by as many people as possible.

129
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:46,395
But specifically we're focused on making
sure that disabled people can use it.

130
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:46,665
Right?

131
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:50,235
These are people that we leave
out a lot in these processes

132
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:51,195
and in the things that we do.

133
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,340
And just abled.

134
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,840
A lot of times people will focus on
blind and visually impaired exclusively.

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,500
So I also want to say, that's
not the limit here at all.

136
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,940
Could be motor disabilities could be
cognitive, could even be temporary.

137
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,930
There are all kinds of situations where
you're like, things may be changing.

138
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,840
What we're going to be
talking today though.

139
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,790
More because Jupyter is a web app
is digital and web accessibility.

140
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,030
So you'll probably also hear the
words with WCAG at some point or a

141
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,850
WCAG the Web Content Accessibility

142
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,070
Guidelines because

143
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,600
those are the major guidelines

144
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,700
used for this type of content.

145
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,090
And other than that, I
think we're good to go.

146
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,760
Are you seeing anything in the chat
Tony that I should be addressing?

147
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,970
Are we getting a lot of people
saying that they are new to this?

148
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,140
Not anything like that.

149
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,180
Tony Fast (he/they): It doesn't seem like
there's any questions, but if anybody has

150
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,590
any, please feel free to throw them out.

151
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,960
I can't find the poll. Did
we, did we put out a poll?

152
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,078
There it is.

153
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:52,710
How do we

154
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,520
show the results?

155
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,750
I click on show results.

156
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,650
There we go.

157
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,820
We've only gotten one vote.

158
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,610
So only one person heard of Jupyter.

159
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,100
Those that are

160
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,900
in hopin right next

161
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,020
Tony Fast (he/they): to

162
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,875
the chat.

163
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,730
, there is

164
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,410
Tony Fast (he/they): a
little tab for polls.

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,030
We'd love if y'all could let us know
some of your experience with Jupyter so

166
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,650
we can gauge this a little bit better.

167
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:14,460
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Okay.

168
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:14,880
Yeah.

169
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,890
And we're exploring this
whole interface too.

170
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,620
So thank you for going
along in that ride with us.

171
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,170
And I'll probably ask you a few
more times since I can't see it

172
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,590
while I'm screen-sharing Tony, but
yeah, that's my quick overview of

173
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,085
accessibility.

174
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,570
One of the

175
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,350
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
other things I want to say,

176
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,970
though, accessibility is not new.

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,360
Right.

178
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,640
I personally seen an uptick in interest
in it recently, which is awesome.

179
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,150
I love to see that, but I think it's
important to remember that this isn't

180
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,660
something that just appeared or that
people haven't been working on, or that

181
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,490
hasn't been a problem for a long time.

182
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,940
So just to point out a few
instances that might be familiar.

183
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:53,295
I am in the U.S. size looking curb
cuts, meaning the kind of ramps in

184
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:58,245
sidewalk curves, which was initially for
wheelchair access have been happening

185
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:02,115
in the U.S, since about the 1940s, even
though they were not required at that

186
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:06,765
time, national legislation starts to
become a little more common globally.

187
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:11,235
So multiple countries between
like the 1990s to the 2000, and

188
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:16,005
we've had some version of web
accessibility guides since 1995.

189
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,415
So these aren't things that have
come up overnight, and there's a

190
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:21,915
lot that we can learn from our past.

191
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,744
However, this is kind of new to Jupyter.

192
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:28,395
There have been people talking about
accessibility for several years,

193
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:32,175
but it's been really a challenge
to get a concerted effort as it is

194
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:34,155
with anything open source, right?

195
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:38,055
There's a lot of back and forth
they're working on volunteer time.

196
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:41,025
So it makes sense, but we're
really trying to ramp that up

197
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,825
and we have a lot to learn here.

198
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,145
So that's part of why we're doing these.

199
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,300
Accessibility is also cross project in

200
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,950
Jupyter.

201
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,250
I spend

202
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,900
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): a
lot of time in certain projects, so

203
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,109
I wanted to make it clear, you know,
this touches all kinds of things.

204
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,140
One of the things, I mean
by this, is that right?

205
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,469
It's not just about the
notebook file or the interface

206
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,969
or the documetation or

207
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:05,039
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): the
organization website or any of that.

208
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,250
Right.

209
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,049
It's actually all of it at once.

210
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,370
And so it's not just one project
problem or one person's problem

211
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,870
or even one team's problem.

212
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:16,830
These are cases where we need to
collaborate and do what we can to do

213
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,390
solutions that can help each other.

214
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,860
And that can carry over, right?

215
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,919
Like if we can do something that
solves it for multiple projects

216
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,120
at once, that'd be awesome.

217
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,530
One example of this in case you're
new to Jupyter, I'm going to explain

218
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,229
this kind of interconnectedness
and JupyterLab, because that's

219
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:32,610
where I spend a lot of my time.

220
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,000
So say we're starting with the notebook
file, which is a totally separate thing

221
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,860
used by a lot of different interfaces.

222
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:39,659
And if

223
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,339
you add Lumino a different

224
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,350
Jupyter project and a bunch of other

225
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,980
things you can end up with Jupyter
Lab in interface for the notebook.

226
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,670
You also

227
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,990
have the documentation with

228
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,680
this, right?

229
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,280
So we've already talked about like
three different Jupyter projects.

230
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,280
And on top of that, we have
RetroLab, which takes Jupyter

231
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,260
Lab components, pulls it apart a
little and uses kind of the most.

232
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,800
But I want to say like the
most foundational ones.

233
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,750
And so we have kind of
the stripped down version.

234
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,110
Now we're at four projects and
of course someone could actually

235
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,380
ignore JupyterLab entirely and
just be working with a notebook in

236
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,410
so many more notebook interfaces.

237
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,120
And then we have a whole bunch of others.

238
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,590
So that is just one small section of
the ecosystem to give you an example

239
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,700
of how this, how this works and why we
are looking for accessibility solutions

240
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,870
that can cover kind of all of these
pieces, all of these Lego blocks.

241
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,590
As I'm showing here to train,
give that idea, Legos will never

242
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,850
stop being a good metaphor.

243
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,780
It's kind of amazing.

244
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,440
Accessibility is also
happening now, right?

245
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,480
This is not something that
we just want to talk about.

246
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,960
We are making some progress,
some highlights from the past

247
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,570
year because we've had really
awesome community members.

248
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,040
We've had regular meetings for a year,
which has just been great for keeping

249
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,250
touch for helping one another, like
people saying, I need to know this.

250
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:56,610
I need to know.

251
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:58,935
We'd also like community growth.

252
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:01,844
Like we've had a lot more people
show up to these meetings, a

253
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:03,375
lot more people bringing ideas.

254
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:09,944
Some people I've never met in Jupyter
before even we also had a WCAG-based

255
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:14,025
audits of multiple projects with
related issues and PRS on GitHub

256
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:15,555
so that we can track the problems.

257
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:18,314
And we can also track what's
works, has been done to fix them.

258
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:23,895
And we have a CZI Essential Open
Source Software for Science grant.

259
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:27,015
We have one for Jupyter accessibility
at the moment, which is awesome

260
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:31,875
because that funding allows us to
pay people to work on this as their

261
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,974
job and not just rely on volunteers.

262
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:37,694
We have had some really amazing
volunteers and I'm super grateful,

263
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:41,145
but this is, this is a big project.

264
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:43,094
So it's wonderful to have
a little bit more going on.

265
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,365
I think that's oh, no way of future goals.

266
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,855
So some other things they're working
on that haven't been touched on

267
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:52,845
yet automated tests, big thing,
and open source projects, for sure.

268
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,235
And we really need them with Jupyter

269
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,875
to avoid our work

270
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,655
being undone.

271
00:10:57,315 --> 00:11:00,795
We need to make sure that the notebook
file format is accessible as can be, as

272
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:02,565
I kind of showed with those Legos, right?

273
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:05,115
That's the foundation of so
many different projects and

274
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,705
even things outside of Project

275
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:07,117
Jupyter.

276
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,355
And we need

277
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:08,805
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
to update

278
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:10,455
improve the documentation,

279
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:12,585
both
making the content more accessible

280
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:14,235
in the format that it's coming in.

281
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:18,135
Of course, we also want to
get you more involved, but

282
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:19,485
we'll get more on that later.

283
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:24,165
There's tons of opportunity if you end
up in joining today's event and yes,

284
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,965
that's what I have to say it for now.

285
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:27,915
Thank you for that overview.

286
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:31,305
I will be able to stop sharing
my screen and be in chat now.

287
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:34,455
So if you have any questions,
I'll do my best to answer them.

288
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:40,455
And I am here to pass it over
to Frank Elavsky, a man who

289
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:41,535
Tania is going to introduce.

290
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:43,095
Yes.

291
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:46,605
Tony Fast (he/they): Wait let's take a,
let's just take a quick delay real quick,

292
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,665
but there are a bunch of people, pretty
much everybody here has heard of Jupyter.

293
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:51,045
So we're good on that.

294
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,535
I think we're going to have another
poll coming out just to find

295
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:55,005
out how people are feeling about

296
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,625
accessibility.

297
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,865
The two

298
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:58,305
Tony Fast (he/they): things that
we're putting together here.

299
00:11:58,305 --> 00:12:00,045
So beyond look out in the chat for

300
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,545
that poll.

301
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,295
, and,

302
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:03,885
, Tony Fast (he/they): thank
you all for the introduction.

303
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,285
And then I'm going to send
it back over to Tania.

304
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:11,485
Tania Allard (she/her): Hi,
y'all I am Tania, my pronouns.

305
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:14,875
Are she/her and I am a Latina woman.

306
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:18,775
With short purple hair and I'm
wearing a black t-shirt

307
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:21,025
purple headphones and black

308
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:21,941
glasses.

309
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,635
It's an

310
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:26,285
honor to
introduce our next speaker, Frank.

311
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:27,505
I am so, so, so

312
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:28,195
excited

313
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:29,555
about his

314
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:32,285
presentation,
Frank, for those of you that don't know,

315
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:37,375
Is a software engineer, returned
researcher, and his currently

316
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:42,565
pursuing a PhD at the intersection
of accessibility and information

317
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:44,455
rich systems and Carnegie Mellon.

318
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:52,195
He's also the author of an amazing tool
or library, called Chartability, which

319
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:57,535
helps us to actually to build more accessible
data, experiences, graphics, and such.

320
00:12:57,595 --> 00:13:01,375
And he'll be talking more about all
of his fabulous work and research.

321
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:07,525
And I think this is the perfect
timing to bring Frank onto

322
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:10,292
the stage.

323
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:13,060
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Hey everybody!
My name is

324
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,020
Frank, pronouns.

325
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,540
He/him. I am a masculine

326
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,120
white man with
my hair, pulled back in a bun and I'm

327
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,860
wearing a gray turtleneck.

328
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,470
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
I'm also in a weirdly lit

329
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:23,965
room.

330
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,450
So I'm doing

331
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,320
my best with lighting

332
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,148
situation here.

333
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:28,390
I had to

334
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,250
move here because
like the neighbors on the other side

335
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,420
of the house are doing construction.

336
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,650
So this is the

337
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,970
quietest room.

338
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,290
Yeah, super

339
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:35,680
glad to

340
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,412
be here.

341
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:37,510
I just want

342
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,640
Frank Elavsky (he/him): to,
before I begin, give a massive

343
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,690
shout out to the folks who have

344
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,120
already spoken and,

345
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,920
Frank Elavsky (he/him): the folks
who have already done work in

346
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,090
order to just make this happen.

347
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,450
I was, you know, Isabela reached
out to me a months ago and said,

348
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,500
Hey, would you like to speak?

349
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,850
And as I've been preparing
materials, I went and dug, I, I

350
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,340
wanted to know what is Jupyter

351
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,190
actually up to what's this

352
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,000
Frank Elavsky (he/him): community doing?

353
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,930
And I was honestly

354
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,580
surprised lots of

355
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,450
Frank Elavsky (he/him): advocacy work.

356
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,020
That's

357
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,420
exhausting work, really,
and lots of trying to

358
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,540
Frank Elavsky (he/him): get

359
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,180
organized.

360
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,460
I noticed

361
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,370
Frank Elavsky (he/him): there's even
an audit that I like it's, you know,

362
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,310
at least a link I think a student
did and I kind of combed through

363
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,830
that and I'm really impressed.

364
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,090
I think there's also a lot of
accessibility that already has like work

365
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,080
that already has been done at least,
you know, from me poking under the hood

366
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,060
and digging around in some notebooks.

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,610
But at the same time, I think
there's a lot of opportunities.

368
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,340
And so today I'm going to be talking about

369
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,440
things that advice.

370
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,560
Frank Elavsky (he/him): So my
own experiences working in open

371
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,700
source communities, working with

372
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,590
accessibility,

373
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,450
and also specifically dealing
with the complexities with what

374
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm calling our data experiences,
the complexities that data

375
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,490
experiences offer and the
challenges making these

376
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:57,760
things

377
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,682
accessible.

378
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:01,450
So yeah, I

379
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,130
think that, that's sort of 
the intro that I wanted

380
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,880
to give.

381
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,380
Thanks again for setting

382
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,670
me up and for bringing

383
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,435
me here.

384
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:08,200
I'm really

385
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,620
excited.

386
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,540
Tania Allard (she/her): 
Okay, fabulous.

387
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,700
So we are going to leave the stage
for Frank and he's going to be taking

388
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,700
questions, at the end of the presentation.

389
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,140
So if you have any questions, feel
free to type them on the stage chat

390
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,750
and we'll pass them off to Frank.

391
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,790
So we'll see you a little bit.

392
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,370
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Great.

393
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,310
Let me get my screen up

394
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,520
and I'm going to make sure
I share my system audio.

395
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:45,205
Okay.

396
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:47,155
It looks like we're

397
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,088
live.

398
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:52,955
So message.

399
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:53,755
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Thank you so much.

400
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:55,226
All right.

401
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:56,648
What do I do?

402
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:57,715
I kind of

403
00:15:57,715 --> 00:16:00,595
have been intro'd already, but 
I'll just talk about, I think

404
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,935
these parts of my background are relevant

405
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:04,620
for today.

406
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,055
I'm currently

407
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:07,825
Frank Elavsky (he/him): actually
researching what I'm calling data

408
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:12,105
interaction or accessibility and
information, rich systems and

409
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,425
go back and forth and exactly
how I want to talk about it.

410
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:17,485
The work that I do, I want to encompass

411
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:22,185
the actual, I want to address

412
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:24,925
Frank Elavsky (he/him): what I
largely refer to as communities

413
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:30,985
who do data work, and I want to
make that work more accessible.

414
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,475
So not just for people who

415
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:38,515
are an audience member or a user of a
chart or graph or interactive data system.

416
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:41,035
But also I want to make the work that

417
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:43,855
people do more accessible

418
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:44,365
as well.

419
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:47,695
So that's my research focus. In

420
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:48,367
the past,

421
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,375
and I currently

422
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,095
organize a group called 
DataVizA11y, where a group

423
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:57,085
of people who do accessibility work
specifically for data visualization.

424
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:59,575
We're all volunteers
we've been meeting for two

425
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:00,247
something years.

426
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:01,255
We do little

427
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,155
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
projects together on

428
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,417
the side.

429
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,942
Lots of advocacy work.

430
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,204
We partner

431
00:17:07,204 --> 00:17:08,815
Frank Elavsky (he/him): with the
Data Visualization Society if

432
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:10,135
anybody's familiar with them.

433
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:10,675
So really

434
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:11,635
big org.

435
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:12,595
That's like

436
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:15,115
Frank Elavsky (he/him): a,
you know, collection of like

437
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,704
20,000 practitioners across

438
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:17,353
the world.

439
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:18,325
I also do

440
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:19,525
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
industry consultations.

441
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:23,005
So between just these things, my hands are

442
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:23,965
full often.

443
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:24,925
My industry

444
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:27,055
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
consultations include like auditing

445
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:28,165
engineering and all kinds of

446
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:30,815
stuff for you know,

447
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:31,915
big companies

448
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:33,564
out there.

449
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:34,389
Sometimes

450
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,790
Frank Elavsky (he/him): it's volunteer
work, but most of the time it's not.

451
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:42,340
And previously I was a staff engineer
on Visa data experience team.

452
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,230
And on the right, we see a bar chart and
this is an example chart component that

453
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,354
we made.

454
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:50,040
And we did

455
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,370
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
a design systems work.

456
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,000
So if any of you are familiar with
what that kind of work entails, that's

457
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,935
what we did.

458
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:57,580
, and,

459
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,700
Frank Elavsky (he/him): yeah, I was the
lead on the accessibility efforts there as

460
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,130
well as you know,

461
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,120
Frank Elavsky (he/him): one of
the main engineers on the project

462
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,500
for all kinds of other stuff, too.

463
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:09,129
And of course, as already
mentioned, I authored Chartability.

464
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,320
So in my own work, in the data

465
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,139
experience space I recognized

466
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:15,520
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
that there were a lot.

467
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:20,755
Things that were unaddressed
or ambiguous in web standards,

468
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:21,865
which isn't the fault web

469
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:22,495
standards.

470
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:23,125
Right,

471
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,385
it's just

472
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:26,065
Frank Elavsky (he/him): a
recognition that the work of

473
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:30,715
accessibility is always
ongoing and changes

474
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:32,425
Frank Elavsky (he/him): often,
depending on our context, in the

475
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:34,765
way we use technology and in the

476
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,805
space of charts and

477
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:37,435
graphs

478
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:39,505
we needed a new set

479
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:42,625
Frank Elavsky (he/him): of
heuristics for testing accessibility.

480
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:46,225
And so I looked at research, I looked
at standards and I looked at communities

481
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,005
of practice to see what are people
already doing and already have opinions

482
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,255
on and what are some needs out there.

483
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,085
And then I collected all of this into

484
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:55,693
a set of tests.

485
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:56,095
Frank Elavsky (he/him): It's

486
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:57,265
kind of an auditing system.

487
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:59,425
So we'll talk more about that later, but

488
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:01,510
that's me.

489
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,595
So yeah,

490
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:07,855
Frank Elavsky (he/him): my passion is
obviously specifically, not just like

491
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:13,555
making data work accessible, but it's like
charts and graphs and data visualizations.

492
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,060
We generally refer to them.

493
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,200
As on the screen here, I've
demonstrated on the left.

494
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,129
We have a bar chart that kind of scales
with negative bars up to positive

495
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:28,930
bars, and it ranges in color from red
on the left, and it slowly becomes

496
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,800
yellow, then a light blue and then to
a dark blue and with the scaling color,

497
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,110
we also have textures lines on these
bars that are changing in angle and

498
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,960
thickness to redundantly

499
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,919
encode the

500
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,925
color scale.

501
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:43,930
That's a

502
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,680
Frank Elavsky (he/him): technique for

503
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,460
low vision.

504
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,240
And then

505
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,870
Frank Elavsky (he/him): on the right,

506
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,030
there's a really interesting

507
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,540
screenshot.

508
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,879
This is from an audit of like a red
arrow pointing into a pie chart that is

509
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:56,830
labeled Google and the rest of ad tech.

510
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,970
And then a big screenshot that
is a contrast checker, noting

511
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,040
that the pie chart has a contrast

512
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,176
failure.

513
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:07,585
So yeah, before

514
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:08,485
we start this,

515
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:10,525
this may be, accessibility

516
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,445
and especially attending 
an accessibility

517
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,155
talk may be new to some of you.

518
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:19,105
And I just want to strongly stress,
please share screenshots of this talk

519
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:20,785
and get you know,

520
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:21,895
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
conversation going.

521
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:26,515
But when you do, if you share screenshots,
make sure you add alt texts very

522
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:26,985
important.

523
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:27,925
I think

524
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:30,295
Frank Elavsky (he/him): almost every time
I've given a talk, there has been one

525
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,845
person who has tagged me in a post without

526
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:33,722
alt texts.

527
00:20:33,722 --> 00:20:35,477
, please don't be shy.

528
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:36,355
, I don't

529
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:37,525
Frank Elavsky (he/him): want
to discourage you from sharing.

530
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:38,695
I really hope that you do.

531
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:40,135
In fact you know,

532
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:41,895
Frank Elavsky (he/him): you all
can just get started, screenshot it

533
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:44,295
right now.

534
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:45,495
, and

535
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:45,895
, Frank Elavsky (he/him): already

536
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:47,635
defined or already

537
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:50,365
Frank Elavsky (he/him): kind of unpack a
little bit is like, what is accessibility?

538
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:54,745
And I kind of want to, I want to talk
really briefly about two ways we use

539
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:57,225
the word accessibility

540
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:58,225
Frank Elavsky (he/him): or accessible

541
00:20:58,225 --> 00:20:59,065
or access.

542
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:00,325
, and I also

543
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,535
Frank Elavsky (he/him): want to note
that if you ever see a 11 Y sometimes.

544
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,040
Allie. ally, eleventy like a nightmare

545
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,250
pronunciation that abbreviation

546
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,030
represents accessibility because 
accessibility as a

547
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,940
word has the letter, a 11 letters and the

548
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,100
letter Y , I don't

549
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,380
know why we chose this as 
a community, but

550
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,350
this, that, that little abbreviation
is how we also refer to it.

551
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,030
So there's two definitions working

552
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,040
definitions that are

553
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,120

important to talk about.

554
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,159
There's one, which is the broad definition
of accessibility, where we say, you

555
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,270
know, it's, it's about the qualities
that make an experience open or usable to

556
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,335
all people.

557
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:42,399
And that's

558
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:44,230
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
like general access, right?

559
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,710
So we have technological access issues.

560
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,100
Like there are access
justice issues for people who

561
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,470
don't have, fast

562
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,240
bandwidth,
internet connection, or any

563
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,464
internet at all.

564
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:57,280
That's an

565
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,190
Frank Elavsky (he/him): access justice
issue, but we also have accessibility

566
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,899
issues specific to people with

567
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:02,672
disabilities.

568
00:22:02,672 --> 00:22:04,990
And we want

569
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,690
Frank Elavsky (he/him): to, we, we're
going to be working mostly in that second

570
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,760
definition, which is where we're defining
it as the knowledge and skills to break

571
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,399
down barriers specifically for people with

572
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:16,135
disabilities.

573
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:21,280
So I want to say that this

574
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,530
is maybe my
favorite graphic that I throw all around

575
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,810
all the time, because it, it does one
thing that is powerful when you're

576
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,550
communicating disability, which is.

577
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:31,855
We're going to

578
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:34,585
kind of expand people's

579
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:36,265
paradigm of how we think 
about what

580
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:37,255
disability is.

581
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,245
I've got

582
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:40,465
Frank Elavsky (he/him): a graphic
here and it's got, it's kind

583
00:22:40,465 --> 00:22:41,965
of represented like a table.

584
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:43,535
It has columns and rows

585
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:46,825
Frank Elavsky (he/him): and on each row
is a, is a functional type of disability.

586
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,005
So they're labeled touch,
see, hear, and speak.

587
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:50,575
And

588
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:52,585
then the columns are actually

589
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:55,345
Frank Elavsky (he/him): temporal
dimensions of disability.

590
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:59,275
So how disability affects
different people depending on time.

591
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,945
So some people have a
permanent disability.

592
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:02,995
And for example, on the

593
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:03,835
touch column, that's

594
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:05,635
Frank Elavsky (he/him): somebody
who just only has one arm.

595
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:08,155
Some people have a temporary disability.

596
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:11,365
And so then there's a person
who just has an arm injury.

597
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:14,365
That means their arm, hopefully,
will heal and then they will

598
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,105
have access to their second arm.

599
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:16,825
And then there's

600
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:20,905
situational, considerations.

601
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:21,955
Frank Elavsky (he/him): And in the

602
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:23,735
final column for touch,

603
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:25,495
Frank Elavsky (he/him): you
might have like a parent holding

604
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:28,970
a child. And

605
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,200
when we think of
something like a curb cuts, which we've

606
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,450
already talked about in a curb cut, we're

607
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,630
designing for you know,

608
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,180
Frank Elavsky (he/him): originally
advocacy was done on behalf

609
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:46,510
and with, and by people who
use wheelchairs, but it turns

610
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,460
out that cutting

611
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,730
Frank Elavsky (he/him): curbs and building
ramps helps people with temporary and

612
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,590
situational limitations

613
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,040
Frank Elavsky (he/him): as well.

614
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,850
So there's kind

615
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,310
of this this way

616
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,560
that I want
to frame disability, where we think

617
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,170
about the challenges that people with
disabilities face as things that we could

618
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,290
also face and maybe also often face.

619
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,750
So the way that I phrase

620
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,340
this is I don't

621
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,970
want to
say that we're like we are disabled

622
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,940
constantly by environmental variables.

623
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,750
We can be.

624
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,700
The right way to talk about this, as
we've all already experienced a disabling

625
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,080
limitation at some point in our labs, even
if it's just temporarily or situationally.

626
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,330
And that means that accessibility,
the work of, of making things

627
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,890
accessible is personal to

628
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,214
all of us.

629
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:37,655
Absolutely,

630
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:38,980
number one, most

631
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,670
important thing to

632
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,710
consider for data

633
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,500
visualization is that virtually

634
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,870
everybody it is, we

635
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,510
have a very, very high rate
of losing

636
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,210
our visual acuity as we age.

637
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,000
And this is just part of aging.

638
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,690
Everyone will face this and it
is massively important for the

639
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,070
field of data visualization.

640
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,300
So it's not, we're not just

641
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,350
considering we're helping

642
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,080
other people who are 
low vision.

643
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:09,280
No, it's very likely going to be
us when we age we're going to need

644
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,997
access.

645
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:12,865
So I see some

646
00:25:12,865 --> 00:25:14,185
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
great things in the chat.

647
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,765
I may have suffered temporary
or situational this morning.

648
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:17,095
Yeah.

649
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:20,965
One of the things for me, it's, if I
have to like kind of pitch to somebody

650
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:23,965
really quickly, I show them something I'm
like, oh, I had this really great thing.

651
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:24,985
I want to show you on my phone.

652
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:27,505
And I try and do this outsider
and a bright location.

653
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:31,015
And I give them my phone and my contrast
is intentionally as low as possible.

654
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:34,495
And they're like, I can't, what,
what are you trying to show me?

655
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:36,235
And I'm like, oh, sorry.

656
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:38,215
And I turned the contrast
up and then they can see.

657
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:43,075
And it's just a way to frame
the fact that our environment

658
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,505
participates in disability.

659
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:46,285
Right.

660
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:50,035
And this is why it's important to
think about the environments we

661
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:55,735
built as participating in disabling
experiences and limitations for

662
00:25:55,735 --> 00:25:59,875
other people are rebuilding an
environment that is potentially

663
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,395
causing some limitation

664
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,715
for someone else's access.

665
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:05,545
That's really, really, really

666
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:06,215
important.

667
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:07,555
Also can

668
00:26:07,555 --> 00:26:09,235
Frank Elavsky (he/him): someone,
I think we started with.

669
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,930
At off time.

670
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,770
Can somebody tell me when, what
time will the 30 minute mark

671
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,780
be from the start of my talk?

672
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,030
Just drop it in private
chat or the comments?

673
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,380
Sorry about the

674
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,770
interruption.

675
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,550
Like, are

676
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,430
Frank Elavsky (he/him): we
running until 30 after right now?

677
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,890
Is that what I'm supposed
to be totally done?

678
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,950
I want to make sure we
have time for questions.

679
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,180
I actually have questions for the

680
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,046
community.

681
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:41,780
And then

682
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,590
Frank Elavsky (he/him): I hope
to also receive questions.

683
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,880
I think that's good.

684
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,540
Okay.

685
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,920
So great.

686
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,550
I'll keep

687
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,480
rolling.

688
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,410
Sorry.

689
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,340
So

690
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,580
Frank Elavsky (he/him): intention
with everything I just said, right?

691
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,350
Keeping in mind that

692
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,680
we can be experienced

693
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,600
Frank Elavsky (he/him): like disabling
limitations or temporary limitations.

694
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,260
I just want to say.

695
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:08,665
The specific barriers that people who
live with disabilities or have permanent

696
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:13,705
disabilities, the barriers that they face
can't be substituted by our experiences.

697
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:17,455
So just because we can put on
a blindfold and pretend to be

698
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:19,345
blind, that absolutely does not

699
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:21,735
mean that our experience

700
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:24,295
Frank Elavsky (he/him): of
simulating or experiencing

701
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:26,425
temporary disabling

702
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:29,575
Frank Elavsky (he/him): limitations
is in any way the same as the

703
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:30,955
experiences that actual people with

704
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:33,490
disabilities face.

705
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,025
So something

706
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:37,615
that I like
to do is just kind of frame the

707
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:40,615
relevance from a data perspective,
especially when I talked to data people,

708
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:41,245
they love numbers.

709
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:41,665
So we're

710
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:42,025
Frank Elavsky (he/him): just going to go

711
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:42,925
through some numbers.

712
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:43,225
The

713
00:27:43,225 --> 00:27:44,995
Frank Elavsky (he/him): world
health organization recognizes

714
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,225
that, you know, globally

715
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:53,815
vision is a significant like a
global health issue , uncorrected

716
00:27:53,815 --> 00:27:57,385
Frank Elavsky (he/him): or uncorrectable,
moderate to severe visual impairment,

717
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:01,015
which we kind of loosely refer to as
low vision, depending on who defines it

718
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:03,281
affects , near.

719
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,390
30%

720
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,720
Frank Elavsky (he/him): of people

721
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,155
globally.

722
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,460
A lot of

723
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:06,850
Frank Elavsky (he/him): that is

724
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,590
preventable by healthcare,

725
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,620
Frank Elavsky (he/him): but what
we're looking at today is just

726
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,597
from a pure numbers perspective.

727
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:15,700
Low vision

728
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,130
Frank Elavsky (he/him): considerations
for accessibility are one of the most

729
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,600
important things we can do to improve
global access to our interactive

730
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,480
systems.

731
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,240
And the

732
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,520
graphic that
I'm showing here is just an example

733
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:34,810
of a set of bars that are very low
contrast on the left using light gray.

734
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,640
On top of the other light grays, the
text is light gray on black or on white.

735
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,200
And then to the right is just
a use of much darker gray for

736
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,113
the text.

737
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:47,070
And

738
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,400
then a dark gray

739
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,890
on white instead

740
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,940
of light gray on light gray.

741
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,770
So improving the way

742
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,620
we design color and

743
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,540
contrast is hugely important.

744
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,710
Plus other techniques for local.

745
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,650
Motor impairment and
functional disability.

746
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,340
This is big.

747
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,490
So just in the United States alone,
motor impairment and functional

748
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,820
disability can, you know, it affects
between 13 and 15% of people.

749
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,190
This is self-reported data from the CDC.

750
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,910
So, you know, a lot of our data
visualization interaction paradigms

751
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,150
use a mouse like you're hovering
on things you're clicking, right?

752
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:19,870
We are very

753
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,440
mouse driven people in

754
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,240
Frank Elavsky (he/him): analytical
spaces, but a lot of people

755
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,100
who have motor impairments

756
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,550
or functional

757
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:33,160
disabilities use assistive
technology like switches

758
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,120
or keyboard

759
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,880
interfaces to interact

760
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,610
with things and
almost everything from, from a technical

761
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,830
perspective uses what's

762
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,110
Frank Elavsky (he/him): called the
keyboard API or the keyboard interface.

763
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,430
So we need to make sure that
our mouse driven interactives

764
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,200
are also keyboard accessible.

765
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,130
This is hugely

766
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,018
important

767
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:55,570
access issue also cognitive

768
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,290
and attention

769
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,356
impairment.

770
00:29:57,356 --> 00:29:59,050
You know,

771
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,620
Frank Elavsky (he/him): this includes

772
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,460
ADHD, autism a wide range

773
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,320
Frank Elavsky (he/him): of other,
you know, intellectual, developmental

774
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,400
disabilities, wide range of

775
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,020
other things affects

776
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,520
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
between 11 and 13% of all

777
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,240
people.

778
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,400
And you know,

779
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,480
Frank Elavsky (he/him): we really have
almost no guidance on how to have, we have

780
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,070
this huge potential, right in interactive
systems, interactive technical systems to

781
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,310
scale, or let user set their preference.

782
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,990
How much explanation do you want?

783
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,170
How much clarity do you
want in text, how much text

784
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,142
you want?

785
00:30:30,142 --> 00:30:31,600
And I think

786
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,770
Frank Elavsky (he/him): that
there's a huge potential for

787
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,210
our field to kind of explore

788
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,070
how can we you know,

789
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,470
Frank Elavsky (he/him): convert
complex language into plain

790
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:38,931
language.

791
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:42,160
What can  we do to to make

792
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,340
more

793
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,490
accessible data experiences

794
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,480
Frank Elavsky (he/him): for, for

795
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,025
these folks?

796
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:49,540
And deep in

797
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,230
Frank Elavsky (he/him): my talk.

798
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,560
I just want to like revisit data

799
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,655
visualization.

800
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:56,845
Now that

801
00:30:56,845 --> 00:30:58,345
Frank Elavsky (he/him): you've
kind of seen me throw data,

802
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:00,415
visualization data experiences.

803
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:04,435
Haven't actually said data representations
yet that sometimes at this point in

804
00:31:04,435 --> 00:31:08,935
the talk I've mentioned it, but I'm
talking about data visualizations

805
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:12,115
because this is the field that
I've worked in for a long time.

806
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:13,735
And I'm really equipped, I think,

807
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:16,255
to engage a lot of

808
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:16,825
Frank Elavsky (he/him): the issues in

809
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,985
this space not just

810
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:20,305
Frank Elavsky (he/him): from an
accessibility standpoint, right?

811
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:23,095
Like I'm a data vis
practitioner, so I can refer

812
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:23,935
to myself.

813
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:24,775
So data

814
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:26,995
Frank Elavsky (he/him): visualization,
sometimes abbreviated data is with a

815
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:30,835
Z or data is with an S is presenting
data in a structured symbolic.

816
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,620
And the structure and semantics
of these things, we create

817
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,470
actually go far beyond the visual.

818
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,180
And so I prefer to call these data
experiences or representations because

819
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,360
that's a little more inclusive when
we're trying to do inclusive work, right.

820
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,290
We should use inclusive language
and talking about experiences or

821
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,340
representations is a little more of
an accurate way to talk about the work

822
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,270
we're really doing under the hood to make
something say, screen reader accessible.

823
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,930
Well, you know, the person with a
screen reeader may or may not even

824
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,740
see the, the

825
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,670
Frank Elavsky (he/him): chart, but they're
going to be perceiving the underlying

826
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,710
structure of it as they interact with it.

827
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,960
And that, that different type of

828
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,850
perception is you know,

829
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,950
we need to be able to talk about it

830
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,970
more than just what the word

831
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,690
visualization.

832
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,850
I love this

833
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,240
demo.

834
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,220
Sarah's a very good friend of mine.

835
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,660
Somebody who I respect

836
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,420
greatly, they recorded

837
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,200
themselves.

838
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,310
They audited a

839
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,000
bunch of

840
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,345
election

841
00:32:34,345 --> 00:32:36,625
graphics,
which are, it's important data, right?

842
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:40,375
We need to make sure that data
about our elections, especially more

843
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,205
and more we've been representing
them in charts and graphs.

844
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:43,495
We need to make sure that

845
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:44,515
they are, they're

846
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:45,025
Frank Elavsky (he/him): accessible.

847
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:50,965
So this is, you know, just one of many
experiences that Sarah captured of

848
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:54,865
what it's like for somebody who uses a
screen reader on their mobile device to

849
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:58,675
interact with a a map, an

850
00:32:58,675 --> 00:33:05,515
election map. Linked video: image, 
image, image, image,

851
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:14,125
image, image, image, image.

852
00:33:15,465 --> 00:33:16,365
Frank Elavsky (he/him): I'm going to 
pause it here.

853
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:16,845
So

854
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,755
we just Sarah is

855
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:23,295
just swiping and
the keyboard focus, which is this kind of

856
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:27,405
white outline around each state is moving
between states, which is fascinating.

857
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,965
Somebody did the work of making

858
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:30,032
keyboard.

859
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:33,520
Or you know non mouse

860
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,120
driven access work, that 
technicality, that

861
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,700
functionality is there under the hood,
but what's missing quite importantly, is

862
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:46,300
all the data about what each state who did

863
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,650
Biden or Trump, win the

864
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,900
state? Is it a win, is it a lead?

865
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,210
Is it a flip what's, what's the status?

866
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,320
And what's even the state.

867
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,300
What state are we currently
on as we navigate?

868
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,790
So really important data itself.

869
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,300
I always say this data is really painful,
but visualization shouldn't be right.

870
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,680
The whole point of visualization is

871
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,570
kind of it performs

872
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:04,690
this

873
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,250
other task.

874
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,810
And why

875
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,670
Frank Elavsky (he/him): am I talking
about data visualization and not

876
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,470
like just broadly data stuff like

877
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,145
notebooks?

878
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:14,170
Well I already

879
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,130
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
sort of spoiled it.

880
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,140
It's like my specialty,

881
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,425
my field,

882
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:19,700
but also

883
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,480
Frank Elavsky (he/him): this
is where I like to reframe how

884
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,070
we think about visualization.

885
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,860
Visualization is actually
already in assistive

886
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,610
technology.

887
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,110
When we

888
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,480
Frank Elavsky (he/him): take data,
something that's hard to understand

889
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,920
and we turn it into a representation
or experience, that's easier to

890
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,080
understand that is an assistive

891
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,928
act.

892
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:39,747
Right?

893
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:43,840
And we are already building

894
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,010
assistive technology.

895
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,830
So my challenge then is to everybody.

896
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,550
Why, why do we

897
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,465
stop there?

898
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:50,380
I think

899
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,150
datavisualizations are really 
helpful starting

900
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:56,050
point because we're already kind of
trying to break down cognitive barriers.

901
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,290
And then my main question
is just why not stop?

902
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,250
Why not keep going?

903
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,780
Why not continue to do what we're

904
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,710
already doing

905
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,640
and try

906
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,240
and make stuff
that's really difficult, not quite as

907
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,930
difficult?

908
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,310
And, and

909
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,380
ultimatelyaccess is about 
breaking down

910
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,300
barriers and assistive

911
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,290
Frank Elavsky (he/him): technology is an

912
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,150
attempt to you know,

913
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,350
overcome barriers using

914
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:17,896
technology.

915
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:20,080
So I want us

916
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,800
to continue this

917
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,045
work and When I frame

918
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:27,815
things with data representation 
and data

919
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:30,335
experience I'm talking

920
00:35:30,335 --> 00:35:34,595
about, because
we're using this, this new inclusive

921
00:35:34,595 --> 00:35:38,705
language, we're going to be talking about
like functional parts of visualization.

922
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:42,515
Like, how does it work when you
interact with it in different ways,

923
00:35:42,695 --> 00:35:44,195
semantically, what does it mean?

924
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:45,005
What are we talking about?

925
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:46,145
What's a bar on a

926
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,240
bar chart?

927
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,335
And, and

928
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:50,915
how do points
on scatterplots relate to each other?

929
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:51,245
Are there

930
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:51,915
outliers?

931
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:53,195
we're also

932
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:55,115
talking structurally, like how have we

933
00:35:55,115 --> 00:36:02,705
prepared this data to be,
 navigated or experienced?

934
00:36:02,705 --> 00:36:03,815
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Is it tabular?

935
00:36:03,815 --> 00:36:05,105
Is it non tabular?

936
00:36:05,105 --> 00:36:06,365
Is it nested or

937
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:06,955
hierarchical?

938
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:08,135
And then

939
00:36:08,135 --> 00:36:09,965
also when we're thinking 
about interactivity,

940
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:11,405
both kinds of interactivity, right?

941
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:11,675
Like.

942
00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:17,905
Interacting using a keyboard to
navigate interacting by like,

943
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:21,445
you know, selecting something,
but also interactive experiences.

944
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:25,495
Like you get in a notebook where you put
in code, you get some kind of output,

945
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:27,325
that's an interactive experience, right.

946
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:28,510
That's a loop.

947
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,695
And so when

948
00:36:29,695 --> 00:36:31,675
we talk about
data representation and data experiences,

949
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:35,845
we're actually encompassing like the
whole picture of what it means to interact

950
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,233
with data.

951
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:39,315
And so here's,

952
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:41,035
here's a question I have for everybody,

953
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:45,755
which is and we'll

954
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:46,825
Frank Elavsky (he/him): spend
a couple of minutes on this.

955
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:50,245
Please put, put your answers
in chat, try and have somebody

956
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:52,255
in mind who asks

957
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:53,185
you this question.

958
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:55,435
Not me, but somebody, right.

959
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:57,025
Somebody you really want to convince.

960
00:36:57,355 --> 00:37:00,535
And they say, how can we make open
source data work more accessible?

961
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:03,625
Maybe there's somebody really important,
or somebody with a lot of power or

962
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:07,465
somebody who's funding, something
you have like one to two sentences to

963
00:37:07,465 --> 00:37:10,015
like, just say, like, here's my answer.

964
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:10,375
Here's what

965
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,076
we can do.

966
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:13,210
Throw it

967
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:13,690
in chat.

968
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,090
I really just want to see
what everybody's ideas are.

969
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,440
And maybe some of you will have
good ideas that, you know, these

970
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,610
are things we actually should say.

971
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,820
So I've got the comment screen
open, please drop this you're

972
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:40,175
answering chat.

973
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:52,530
Frank Elavsky (he/him):  So there

974
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,580
are a couple up in the thread.

975
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,410
Oh yeah.

976
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,920
Cause I asked it earlier just
as a test of the chat system.

977
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:03,710
Hmm.

978
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,370
Thank you.

979
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,520
Established channel for feedback.

980
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,280
Hm.

981
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,540
Cameron also said something.

982
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,650
Yeah.

983
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,580
Great.

984
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,350
Yeah.

985
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,050
So I'm just going to speak
these out loud while folks still

986
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,277
try and add their own input.

987
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:55,763
Okay.

988
00:38:55,763 --> 00:38:56,250
So

989
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,550
starting all the
way back, Anette said first thought

990
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,690
established channels for feedback
from folks with disabilities, as

991
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,820
they say nothing about us without us.

992
00:39:07,255 --> 00:39:07,795
Cameron:

993
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:13,165
I am, I'm newer to data work, but perhaps
even some simple things like making sure

994
00:39:13,165 --> 00:39:14,725
there's good documentation and

995
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:16,375
making sure visualizations
are accessible as a start.

996
00:39:16,465 --> 00:39:16,825
Yes.

997
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:17,305
Love that.

998
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:22,315
Let's see,

999
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:30,345
make it part of a standard review
process that was Isabela posting

1000
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:38,075
as Tania, then Cameron said, make
sure that we use the tools we use

1001
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,485
to do data work are accessible.

1002
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:44,645
Annette said, figure out how to
enable sonification. Peyton educate

1003
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:50,705
the broader community. More training
on how to make data work accessible.

1004
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:57,425
R Ely said include accessibility,
best practices in tutorial

1005
00:39:57,425 --> 00:40:04,115
instructions. Gabriel: hire people,
but maybe in tension with open source.

1006
00:40:04,145 --> 00:40:05,765
Yes, that is a huge tension in 
open source.

1007
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,730
Thinking about the practice
known as dog fooding.

1008
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,320
Oh, I don't know what that is.

1009
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:17,300
Might when we get to open
discussion at the end, it might

1010
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,380
be great to hear more about that.

1011
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,330
Rose create a system of questions
or considerations to iterate through.

1012
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:23,870
Hmm.

1013
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:24,740
That's good.

1014
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,870
Mars:

1015
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,970
Agree on making
accessibility part of review.

1016
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,750
Yeah.

1017
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,190
Part of the cultural expectation.

1018
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,580
I like that.

1019
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,930
That's been said twice now.

1020
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,530
Yes.

1021
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,340
Okay.

1022
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,470
Tania: sort of a chicken and
egg, but also making sure our

1023
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,730
communities are more inclusive.

1024
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,390
Oh yeah.

1025
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,080
That is the big chicken and
egg problem in communities.

1026
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,970
It's like, it's like there was a
community organizing meeting that

1027
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:51,710
I went to, where they were trying
to, like, they had identified

1028
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,760
members of the community who had

1029
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,920
mobility , disabilities

1030
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,400
and the building that everybody was

1031
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,630
meeting in was not accessible.

1032
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,530
There was

1033
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,587
no ramp.

1034
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:04,645
Rose more

1035
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:07,375
specific improved
command line, terminal interfaces.

1036
00:41:07,435 --> 00:41:07,945
Ooh,

1037
00:41:07,975 --> 00:41:08,770
interesting.

1038
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,155
I'm really interested.

1039
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,745
I think

1040
00:41:12,745 --> 00:41:15,265
maybe that could be an interesting 
discussion later.

1041
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:19,675
Most folks I know who are blind or low
vision and use a screen reader actually

1042
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:23,875
prefer command line interfaces to every
other kind of graphical user interface or

1043
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,408
anything else.

1044
00:41:25,408 --> 00:41:26,175
because

1045
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:27,595
to them it's just

1046
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:28,540
pure text.

1047
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,485
But I'd

1048
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:30,925
love to normalize no mouse days.

1049
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:31,495
Yes.

1050
00:41:32,275 --> 00:41:33,325
I love using no mouse.

1051
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:33,805
Yes.

1052
00:41:33,835 --> 00:41:34,808
Okay, cool.

1053
00:41:34,808 --> 00:41:35,295
That's,

1054
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:35,815
Frank Elavsky (he/him): that's plenty.

1055
00:41:35,815 --> 00:41:36,760
That's a lot.

1056
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:37,705
I hope you

1057
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:39,205
Frank Elavsky (he/him): all
keep this conversation going.

1058
00:41:39,505 --> 00:41:41,695
And I think we had some
really good answers in here.

1059
00:41:41,725 --> 00:41:44,665
I was wondering if anybody would
try and be super ambitious and big

1060
00:41:44,695 --> 00:41:47,905
and some of these are big, but I
would actually say you all did a

1061
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,855
good job of keeping these winable.

1062
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,000
These are things you could really

1063
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,600
do.

1064
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,400
And now I'm

1065
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,350
going to kind of dig into, I have 
a background in

1066
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,920
community organizing, and I have some
advice that I want to give to you all.

1067
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,570
So here's like 10 strategies.

1068
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,150
I'm going to talk a little more
about the first four, and then

1069
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,720
I'll just let you have that kind
of structural advice for your own

1070
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,255
stewing.

1071
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:10,790
But,

1072
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,100
let's break into the things that

1073
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,020
you as an individual can do.

1074
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,060
Four things that I think
are really good to keep

1075
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,710
in mind on the quest

1076
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:17,800
for

1077
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,332
accessibility.

1078
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:19,930
I just want

1079
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,940
to preface that not all action is

1080
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,170
solved by individuals alone.

1081
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:23,290
And

1082
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,530
in fact very little

1083
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,690
is especially
if we're really thinking about how

1084
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,250
connected we are to our work and our

1085
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:30,850
environment.

1086
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,050
So much

1087
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,180
of what we do is dependent and 
interactive

1088
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,560
with others.

1089
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,250
Especially

1090
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:36,700
in open source.

1091
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:41,075
So I'm always, always, always
keep in mind the structural

1092
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:43,355
picture of, of things

1093
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:43,565
that are

1094
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:45,755
happening beyond just

1095
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:46,595
you as a person.

1096
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:50,315
And the first thing I want to say
is, you know, learn how to evaluate,

1097
00:42:50,405 --> 00:42:53,435
I've been in this space for a very
long time, check out Chartability.

1098
00:42:53,435 --> 00:42:57,545
If you haven't check out WCAG, which
is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,

1099
00:42:57,815 --> 00:42:59,825
just kind of learn. Like don't reinvent

1100
00:42:59,825 --> 00:43:00,715
the wheel.

1101
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:01,605
And you

1102
00:43:01,655 --> 00:43:03,695
certainly don't
want to invite people with disabilities

1103
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:06,095
to kind of help you in your quest.

1104
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,435
If you haven't done what
I consider to be the

1105
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:10,095
bare minimum, which is

1106
00:43:10,145 --> 00:43:11,765
evaluate your own systems and

1107
00:43:11,795 --> 00:43:13,475
try and, you

1108
00:43:13,475 --> 00:43:15,575
know, meet a decent standard of

1109
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:16,745
access according to those

1110
00:43:16,745 --> 00:43:17,415
standards.

1111
00:43:17,415 --> 00:43:18,755
That's step

1112
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:19,085
one.

1113
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:20,555
This is my itself,

1114
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,315
quite a long quest.

1115
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:25,615
So but get started.

1116
00:43:25,615 --> 00:43:26,765
And I'd

1117
00:43:26,765 --> 00:43:29,495
love feedback on Chartability too, 
as you all interact with

1118
00:43:29,495 --> 00:43:32,585
it, more and more folks using it would be
really helpful because it's an open source

1119
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:36,085
project too. This next

1120
00:43:36,085 --> 00:43:38,305
one is huge and open source.

1121
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:41,845
The tension is like you're
trying to do everything for free.

1122
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:45,985
And often people with disabilities
are asked to do work for free

1123
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,070
too much.

1124
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,085
Cause everybody

1125
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:48,625
wants them.

1126
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:53,125
So one of the best pieces of advice that
I have is obviously invite people to join

1127
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:56,905
you, but also just find where they're
already talking about stuff like Liz Hare.

1128
00:43:56,905 --> 00:43:57,655
I love Liz.

1129
00:43:57,685 --> 00:43:58,825
Liz is amazing, really

1130
00:43:58,825 --> 00:43:59,365
outspoken.

1131
00:43:59,365 --> 00:44:00,985
Has a

1132
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:02,605
lot of interesting things to say on

1133
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:03,385
Twitter.

1134
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:04,945
Really outspoken

1135
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:05,395
in the R

1136
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:08,905
community and. So find

1137
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:10,435
where they're already speaking, right?

1138
00:44:10,465 --> 00:44:14,725
Like that's a way to help them
avoid like doing redundant work.

1139
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,035
They're already doing the work
of trying to educate people.

1140
00:44:17,035 --> 00:44:19,965
So like go to wherever they're at
and just join their communities.

1141
00:44:19,975 --> 00:44:20,965
It doesn't have to be Twitter,

1142
00:44:21,185 --> 00:44:21,720
you know?

1143
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,255
There are

1144
00:44:22,255 --> 00:44:22,975
lots of places you

1145
00:44:22,975 --> 00:44:24,355
could go.

1146
00:44:24,355 --> 00:44:25,045
Another

1147
00:44:25,045 --> 00:44:26,845
thing that I want to say is pace yourself, work

1148
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:29,065
on just a single new thing at a time.

1149
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,840
I have done this.

1150
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,200
And honestly, I think it's the only
way I've survived certain periods

1151
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,880
of my life on the quest towards
anything but especially accessibility.

1152
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:44,770
So right now I'm like digging into like
touch and keyboard interaction, paradigms.

1153
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:50,515
Thinking about how we structure data to
like, make those interaction paradigms,

1154
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:53,095
like really seamless and powerful and

1155
00:44:53,095 --> 00:44:53,605
empowering.

1156
00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:54,625
And that's

1157
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,025
just where I'm at right now, digging 
into these issues.

1158
00:44:57,025 --> 00:45:01,015
So like even, even me, I'm always
working on just one thing at a time.

1159
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:04,465
And if you overwhelm yourself with
trying to solve all of accessibility

1160
00:45:04,465 --> 00:45:07,225
at once that's not that's not

1161
00:45:07,225 --> 00:45:09,145
sustainable for an open source 
community, right?

1162
00:45:09,205 --> 00:45:12,715
The advantage of open source is that
if you're going to do one thing, you're

1163
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:15,355
going to really hope that somebody else
is going to be doing their thing too.

1164
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:19,405
And if we all do that, there might be
a chance to really engage something

1165
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:20,665
at scale with a bunch

1166
00:45:20,665 --> 00:45:22,435
of broad and difficult problems.

1167
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,605
And then this one, this is, this is
really from my community organizing

1168
00:45:26,605 --> 00:45:29,755
background, which is break issues
into smaller, manageable parts.

1169
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:30,505
I found an

1170
00:45:30,505 --> 00:45:33,695
audit online of,

1171
00:45:33,745 --> 00:45:36,025
I think a student did have something

1172
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,525
in Jupyter and it's great.

1173
00:45:37,525 --> 00:45:40,165
It's like a full WCAG
audit, but there's a lot in

1174
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:41,211
there.

1175
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:44,350
And , I would

1176
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,420
say that if you ever end up 
in a situation

1177
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:51,070
like this, try and break anything
into the smallest pieces you can so

1178
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:53,470
that you can get small wins quickly.

1179
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,790
That is so important in open source
and especially volunteer communities

1180
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,140
because people will burn out

1181
00:45:59,140 --> 00:45:59,860
otherwise.

1182
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,020
And you

1183
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,390
know, I, I think that broadly 
the organizing

1184
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,070
community has a lot

1185
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:06,340
Frank Elavsky (he/him): that could

1186
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,110
teach us about open

1187
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,840
source work that we really, you 
know, most open

1188
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,750
source communities don't pay attention
to, but especially with something

1189
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,220
important and related

1190
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:15,760
to justice,

1191
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,930
like access you know,
Jupyter has has a chance

1192
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,960
to negotiate access in a way that

1193
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,970
like Plotly couldn't right.

1194
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,770
You all are the platform that most
people come together on to do their work.

1195
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,400
And say, for example,
you just had, you know, a

1196
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,920
really simple requirement

1197
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,840
that, you know, libraries need to be

1198
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,130
able to provide like, need you need.

1199
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,020
Be able to provide a way for
users to add alt text to all

1200
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,698
of your charts and graphs.

1201
00:46:46,698 --> 00:46:47,770
That's not

1202
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:48,520
 a problem we want

1203
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,345
to solve.

1204
00:46:49,345 --> 00:46:50,170
You need

1205
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:51,220
to be able to do it and here's when

1206
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,210
we need it by or something.

1207
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:52,720
I don't know.

1208
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,900
I don't know if that's actually winnable,
but it's an example of like one small

1209
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,330
thing then you can do as a community with

1210
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,770
your power.

1211
So yeah.

1212
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,650
And then

1213
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,510
there's structural strategies.

1214
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,930
Maybe just take a screenshot of
this, save it, stew on it later.

1215
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:10,240
I'm not going to like kind
of walk through all of this.

1216
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,890
The first five are like really common
to like strategies for implementing

1217
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:16,630
accessibility and organizations.

1218
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,560
And I would add,

1219
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,030
I added number six because

1220
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:19,750
it's important for

1221
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,120
volunteer and like open

1222
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,130
source work, which is celebrate your wins.

1223
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,470
Like very intentionally.

1224
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:32,290
So like, I hope that by the end of today,
everybody, except the people who organized

1225
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,580
all of you, it's your job to put together
an event where you thank the people

1226
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,170
who have done all the work until now.

1227
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,150
Like, please, please,
please celebrate them.

1228
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:45,935
Like learn their names, send
them emails, thank them for what

1229
00:47:45,935 --> 00:47:46,910
they've done.

1230
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:47,885
That is

1231
00:47:47,885 --> 00:47:52,775
hugely important because burnout is, 
is real and it is so

1232
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:53,549
stressful.

1233
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:56,645
Anxiety inducing. The pressure

1234
00:47:56,645 --> 00:47:58,865
is real in this work and people 
who are doing

1235
00:47:58,865 --> 00:48:02,585
the work you know,
celebrate them and celebrate

1236
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:03,695
yourself too for what you've

1237
00:48:03,695 --> 00:48:04,762
done.

1238
00:48:04,762 --> 00:48:07,965
So I think

1239
00:48:08,015 --> 00:48:09,275
let's see
for the sake of time, I'm gonna

1240
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:11,615
maybe like, just briefly talk about

1241
00:48:11,615 --> 00:48:13,505
evaluation because

1242
00:48:13,505 --> 00:48:14,525
I think it's step one.

1243
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:15,365
It's what everybody

1244
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:16,415
should learn.

1245
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:18,515
And then we'll just

1246
00:48:18,515 --> 00:48:20,255
Open things up
for discussion with the time we have

1247
00:48:20,255 --> 00:48:21,785
left.

1248
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:24,845
So learning

1249
00:48:24,845 --> 00:48:27,155
how to evaluate
is something that anyone can do.

1250
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,795
You can be a designer, you can
be an engineer, you can be an

1251
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:31,875
analyst an auditor.

1252
00:48:31,925 --> 00:48:32,675
Obviously auditors

1253
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:33,665
audit, right?

1254
00:48:33,665 --> 00:48:34,655
But even

1255
00:48:34,655 --> 00:48:37,445
managers, everybody should have like an

1256
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:38,313
instinct.

1257
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:39,990
And you

1258
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,990
get instincts like that looks 
like it's low contrast.

1259
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,410
You get an instinct like that when you
just have a set of standards that you

1260
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,269
regularly rely on and, you know, right?

1261
00:48:48,269 --> 00:48:51,359
So you got to build that system, or
you've got to build that knowledge and

1262
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,669
experience in order

1263
00:48:53,669 --> 00:48:56,129
to be able to just have an instinct, 
I can look at something

1264
00:48:56,189 --> 00:48:58,740
now and say that it looks low contrast.

1265
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,459
Let's, let's

1266
00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:01,786
check it.

1267
00:49:01,786 --> 00:49:02,949
And,

1268
00:49:02,999 --> 00:49:04,709
looking to standards is the best first

1269
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:08,339
step, because standards are
going to be consistent, right?

1270
00:49:08,399 --> 00:49:09,930
Standards change very slowly.

1271
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,339
So it's a good step one for

1272
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:11,939
evaluating.

1273
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,140
I always

1274
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,559
talk about how, you know, thousands 
of years ago, people

1275
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,149
use stilled wood fasteners, or like
screws by hand, and none of them were

1276
00:49:21,149 --> 00:49:21,809
interchangeable.

1277
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:23,129
They would

1278
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:24,390
break down easily.

1279
00:49:24,689 --> 00:49:27,990
It takes forever to build and
data visualization is like that.

1280
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,849
It takes a long time to
build a lot of stuff.

1281
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:31,919
What we do from scratch is from scratch.

1282
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:35,069
It feels pretty flimsy, but
when you look the standards

1283
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:36,720
like the Phillips screw standard

1284
00:49:36,939 --> 00:49:38,447
revolutionized

1285
00:49:38,447 --> 00:49:39,954
fasteners

1286
00:49:39,954 --> 00:49:42,744
as an industry and it enabled us to 
have automobiles

1287
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:44,064
and a whole bunch of other things, right.

1288
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:47,124
You can go to a hardware store and get a
Phillips screw and you expect it to work

1289
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:48,301
pretty well.

1290
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:50,065
And I want

1291
00:49:50,065 --> 00:49:52,945
that for data
visualization, at least at a low level.

1292
00:49:52,945 --> 00:49:55,165
And especially for things
like accessibility, I want an

1293
00:49:55,165 --> 00:49:56,815
accessible, interchangeable

1294
00:49:56,815 --> 00:49:59,395
experience across across environments,

1295
00:49:59,395 --> 00:50:00,055
across the world.

1296
00:50:00,055 --> 00:50:02,605
And in order to get there, we
all have to get on the same page

1297
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:04,285
with how we're evaluating things.

1298
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:06,475
So look at

1299
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:08,035
WCAG, if somebody

1300
00:50:08,035 --> 00:50:09,985
hasn't dropped the homepage and 
chat the link

1301
00:50:09,985 --> 00:50:12,835
for just Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, that'd be great.

1302
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:13,495
Just drop it in.

1303
00:50:13,795 --> 00:50:16,225
It informs policy by

1304
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:20,825
governments that you know represent

1305
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:23,005
like more than half of the world's 
population.

1306
00:50:23,004 --> 00:50:25,474
So it's and it's

1307
00:50:25,524 --> 00:50:28,464
anticipated to be adopted at a 
policy by

1308
00:50:28,464 --> 00:50:30,834
2025, I think 90% of the world's

1309
00:50:30,834 --> 00:50:31,918
population.

1310
00:50:31,918 --> 00:50:34,084
So like,

1311
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:36,174
yeah, at least get on the same 
page with WCAG.

1312
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:41,529
And then there's tons of
research that shows that what

1313
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:42,879
WCAG does not go far enough.

1314
00:50:42,879 --> 00:50:43,179
Right?

1315
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:46,269
And talk to anybody who's
interacted with a compliant system.

1316
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:48,249
Who's disabled, they'll
have feedback still.

1317
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:48,579
Right.

1318
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,379
So after you do your due diligence, this
is the last note I really want to end

1319
00:50:53,379 --> 00:50:57,879
on, which is please involve people with
disabilities and yes, you should probably

1320
00:50:57,879 --> 00:50:58,699
pay them.

1321
00:50:59,109 --> 00:50:59,929
I know that's

1322
00:50:59,979 --> 00:51:02,139
in tension with open-source, but you have to

1323
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:03,879
incentivize things even in an open source

1324
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:06,729
community and. and

1325
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:07,269
try and make it

1326
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:07,797
fair.

1327
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:09,909
So I have some

1328
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:12,309
advice on making your collaborative 
collaborators lives

1329
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:13,449
easier, then I'm just going to breeze

1330
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:14,709
through number one, invite

1331
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:14,919
them to

1332
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:15,354
discussions.

1333
00:51:15,354 --> 00:51:16,659
Number two, find

1334
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:17,379
where they're at

1335
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:19,039
enjoying them.

1336
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:20,569
That's powerful.

1337
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,339
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
Not for many people

1338
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:22,359
do that.

1339
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:23,379
Three: try

1340
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:26,829
and write up issues on your repo with 
them or for them.

1341
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:30,309
Don't always just expect like people
to come to you with problems, like be

1342
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:32,529
proactive empower

1343
00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:32,619
them

1344
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:35,409
to help drive design

1345
00:51:35,409 --> 00:51:36,429
decisions that affect them.

1346
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:39,099
So if you're like, Ooh, we have this tough
issue with low vision, do you want to

1347
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,239
help us?

1348
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:41,379
That's powerful

1349
00:51:41,379 --> 00:51:42,519
if they

1350
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:42,939
get to be a

1351
00:51:42,939 --> 00:51:44,869
co-designer right.

1352
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:48,729
And then if you're

1353
00:51:48,729 --> 00:51:50,199
Frank Elavsky (he/him): going to
pay anybody in the whole process

1354
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:54,069
of open source, I like to just argue
you pay people with disabilities

1355
00:51:54,249 --> 00:51:55,959
because their expertise is very rare.

1356
00:51:55,959 --> 00:51:56,829
It's very demand.

1357
00:51:56,859 --> 00:52:00,159
And from a justice perspective,
they're often, far too often

1358
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,749
asked to do things for free.

1359
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,329
I am asked to do things for free all

1360
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:07,272
the time and my disabilities.

1361
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:08,449
I navigate

1362
00:52:08,499 --> 00:52:09,189
through life.

1363
00:52:09,189 --> 00:52:10,719
So I'm always thankful

1364
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:12,909
when people compensate

1365
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:14,649
me for work or for speaking or for

1366
00:52:14,649 --> 00:52:15,319
anything.

1367
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:16,659
I'm hugely

1368
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:17,019
grateful

1369
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:17,769
for that.

1370
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:18,519
But everybody's

1371
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:19,539
going to have a different level of

1372
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:21,609
commitment and experience and

1373
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:25,929
expectation and
starting with you know,

1374
00:52:25,929 --> 00:52:26,739
a standard.

1375
00:52:27,504 --> 00:52:32,154
A rate that you hope to pay people
before you talk to them and offer

1376
00:52:32,154 --> 00:52:34,074
that upfront is the best way

1377
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:34,812
to do it.

1378
00:52:34,812 --> 00:52:35,304
So that

1379
00:52:35,304 --> 00:52:36,414
you don't expect them to

1380
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:37,449
ask you.

1381
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:38,484
And then

1382
00:52:38,484 --> 00:52:41,784
the last advice I have is try to 
use what

1383
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:47,004
already exists, both to integrate
into your own work, but also just as

1384
00:52:47,004 --> 00:52:48,954
inspiration, the number one place

1385
00:52:48,954 --> 00:52:50,424
I always point to is Highcharts.

1386
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,704
I, I

1387
00:52:52,704 --> 00:52:54,284
love them.

1388
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:55,074
Oystein

1389
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:59,994
is a good friend and you know, his 
work with Ted

1390
00:53:00,324 --> 00:53:04,494
at Elsevier, they have created what I
think is one of the most impressive and

1391
00:53:04,494 --> 00:53:07,014
accessible libraries

1392
00:53:07,014 --> 00:53:08,754
out there for doing data visualization.

1393
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:10,494
And you can just go

1394
00:53:10,494 --> 00:53:12,354
to their accessibility

1395
00:53:12,354 --> 00:53:14,274
page and just dig into the richness 
that they have

1396
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,526
to offer.

1397
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,654
So that's it I forgot

1398
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:19,434
to send slides.

1399
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:20,124
So I think I

1400
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:23,094
emailed Isabela

1401
00:53:23,094 --> 00:53:24,804
right before my talk started.

1402
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,874
And hopefully we can get
the slides to everybody.

1403
00:53:26,934 --> 00:53:27,324
I don't know how

1404
00:53:27,325 --> 00:53:35,154
we put up put up
stuff, but yeah, it'd

1405
00:53:35,154 --> 00:53:36,504
be great if you could all get the 
slides so you can

1406
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,884
get the resources and stuff and that's

1407
00:53:37,884 --> 00:53:39,322
it.

1408
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:40,759
Thanks.

1409
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,634
Tony Fast (he/they): Frank, that

1410
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:44,955
was, that was incredible.

1411
00:53:45,645 --> 00:53:46,004
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Thank you

1412
00:53:46,004 --> 00:53:47,285
so much.

1413
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:48,564
Tony Fast (he/they):  It really

1414
00:53:48,564 --> 00:53:50,874
reinforces how important the advocacy work is.

1415
00:53:50,904 --> 00:53:55,374
Like you definitely left with things that
organizations can take and really empower

1416
00:53:55,374 --> 00:53:55,954
accessibility.

1417
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:57,115
Thank you

1418
00:53:57,115 --> 00:53:59,214
so much right now.

1419
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:00,325
Let's take some questions.

1420
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:00,834
I hope you all

1421
00:54:00,834 --> 00:54:02,095
have been hanging

1422
00:54:02,095 --> 00:54:03,265
out, getting ready for

1423
00:54:03,265 --> 00:54:04,297
this time.

1424
00:54:04,297 --> 00:54:05,845
If you want

1425
00:54:05,845 --> 00:54:09,024
to throw your questions into

1426
00:54:09,055 --> 00:54:13,704
the chat you know praise and

1427
00:54:13,704 --> 00:54:16,615
kind words will also find their way 
there that we

1428
00:54:16,615 --> 00:54:17,979
can share.

1429
00:54:17,979 --> 00:54:19,345
But yeah,

1430
00:54:19,345 --> 00:54:19,974
Isabela, I'm

1431
00:54:19,974 --> 00:54:21,115
curious while we're

1432
00:54:21,115 --> 00:54:23,634
waiting for questions to roll in, 
are there

1433
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:26,454
any questions that came to mind
to you while you were watching

1434
00:54:26,454 --> 00:54:27,234
Frank's talk?

1435
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:32,589
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
I mean, yes, but I'm trying

1436
00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:33,879
to filter what's useful.

1437
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:34,450
I know

1438
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,950
one that brought

1439
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,470
up kind of at the end was about 
specifications.

1440
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,799
Right.

1441
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:43,359
Which is something that's on my mind a
lot, because especially with, I am, since

1442
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,979
I'm not really a code contributor to open
source projects, I'm not the main one.

1443
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:49,870
What am I going to say?

1444
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:53,140
I'm not going to be the main one,
writing the guts of the things.

1445
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,200
And so it really matters to me trying
to set up something so that people

1446
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,819
can figure out what they need to do.

1447
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:58,149
Right.

1448
00:54:58,149 --> 00:54:59,950
And that's how I see specifications too.

1449
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:06,249
So with that, I guess I would want to ask,
like, what, how do you prioritize that?

1450
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:06,430
Right.

1451
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:10,120
You have Chartability kind of
has a specification going on.

1452
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,529
How do you sort those things?

1453
00:55:11,529 --> 00:55:13,209
How do you prioritize things?

1454
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,319
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Good

1455
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:14,836
question.

1456
00:55:14,836 --> 00:55:16,899
So 18F is

1457
00:55:16,899 --> 00:55:18,939
a government agency and they 
actually have

1458
00:55:18,939 --> 00:55:22,240
like this super rad like list of
like accessibility priorities.

1459
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:26,560
So if you want to like offload
prioritization to somebody else, like

1460
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,229
look at what they, how they prioritize.

1461
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:34,029
The, the reason I say this big is
because when you make question,

1462
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,350
you make a decision about

1463
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:37,870
priorities especially

1464
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:38,020
in the

1465
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,550
accessibility space,

1466
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,080
it's, it's

1467
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,100
Frank Elavsky (he/him): difficult
to be fair and know what's fair.

1468
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:49,509
And I point to 18F because
they're a government agency,

1469
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,750
a lot of decision-making
went into their own list of

1470
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,390
priorities.

1471
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,309
So for like

1472
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,230
specifically web

1473
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,819
content they have

1474
00:55:57,819 --> 00:55:58,779
like a great breakdown.

1475
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,529
I would all tab and go find it, but
maybe somebody can go quick and drop it

1476
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:05,176
in chat.

1477
00:56:05,176 --> 00:56:06,499
But

1478
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:10,480
also another thing that you should keep 
intention with like a

1479
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,209
priorities list that's like,

1480
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:16,329
top-down is always allow the community

1481
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:17,829
to disrupt your priorities.

1482
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:21,549
If somebody comes to you and they're
like, Hey, I need this thing.

1483
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:24,429
And I'm like doing this
thing, honestly, like if

1484
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:25,524
you have

1485
00:56:25,524 --> 00:56:26,619
like

1486
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:28,119
an open source community in place

1487
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,799
that can support feedback

1488
00:56:29,799 --> 00:56:30,774
like that.

1489
00:56:30,774 --> 00:56:31,749
And you

1490
00:56:31,749 --> 00:56:35,949
have bandwidth to flex, like help 
people as they

1491
00:56:35,949 --> 00:56:39,699
come to you because that's powerful
and there's going to be traction.

1492
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:43,179
Anytime a person comes to you
with an issue that you're not,

1493
00:56:43,449 --> 00:56:44,529
it's going to be hard to generate.

1494
00:56:44,529 --> 00:56:48,009
It's hard to generate traction
from your own list of priorities.

1495
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:50,649
It's very easy to generate
traction when somebody comes

1496
00:56:50,649 --> 00:56:53,229
to you and is like, Hey, I need

1497
00:56:53,229 --> 00:56:54,384
this thing.

1498
00:56:54,384 --> 00:56:55,539
So yeah,

1499
00:56:55,539 --> 00:56:57,279
that's kind of my advice on that.

1500
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:02,679
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
That's yeah, that's really,

1501
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:05,885
that's a good summary.

1502
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:06,549
That

1503
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:06,669
was

1504
00:57:06,669 --> 00:57:07,099
awesome.

1505
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:07,959
Tony Fast (he/they): It looks

1506
00:57:07,959 --> 00:57:09,519
like we do have some questions or

1507
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:10,089
comments.

1508
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:14,079
Mars pjped in saying that she found

1509
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,269
out about free pik through this talk.

1510
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:19,209
So she's going to use those
stylish factors that people, but

1511
00:57:19,209 --> 00:57:23,109
I'm also going to share a post
that Mars wrote for Quansight Labs

1512
00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:25,489
about making NumPy accessible.

1513
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:26,979
She's been doing tons of work on

1514
00:57:26,979 --> 00:57:28,189
NumPy's documentation,

1515
00:57:28,189 --> 00:57:29,949
making things accessible, and she

1516
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:31,719
wrote a really rad blog post

1517
00:57:31,769 --> 00:57:32,987
as to why.

1518
00:57:32,987 --> 00:57:33,799
So that's,

1519
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:35,289
that's gonna, that's shared in the chat

1520
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:36,129
right now.

1521
00:57:36,129 --> 00:57:39,069
And then  let's see we got this

1522
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:40,299
link to 18F shared.

1523
00:57:40,299 --> 00:57:41,289
I wasn't aware of that.

1524
00:57:41,289 --> 00:57:42,009
Thank you for bringing

1525
00:57:42,009 --> 00:57:43,943
that up.

1526
00:57:43,943 --> 00:57:44,909
Ely,

1527
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,079
Ely ran an awesome accessibility,

1528
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:48,489
community accessibility workshop

1529
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:49,413
last year.

1530
00:57:49,413 --> 00:57:51,159
She said she's going

1531
00:57:51,159 --> 00:57:51,339
to be

1532
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:52,959
using the argument that data

1533
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:55,299
representation and visualizations is 
already a form

1534
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:57,699
of accessibility, which I kind of love

1535
00:57:58,539 --> 00:57:58,979
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Credit.

1536
00:57:58,989 --> 00:57:59,439
I'm going to type.

1537
00:58:00,219 --> 00:58:04,179
The very first person who coined
that is a super good friend of mine.

1538
00:58:04,209 --> 00:58:04,689
Probably.

1539
00:58:04,749 --> 00:58:08,379
I dunno, I don't want to be corny, but
maybe my best friend in this space.

1540
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:09,579
His name is Doug

1541
00:58:09,579 --> 00:58:10,539
Shepherds,

1542
00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:12,459
he's been

1543
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:14,859
in, he used to work at W3C.

1544
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:16,509
He's been in web standards for years.

1545
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:18,009
He's a data visualization guy.

1546
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:19,359
He cares a lot about this stuff.

1547
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:21,519
I don't know if he'll say this
out loud, but he's one of the

1548
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:23,589
reasons we have SVG on the web as a

1549
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:24,069
standard.

1550
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:25,989
So I love Doug.

1551
00:58:25,989 --> 00:58:26,649
He's the first

1552
00:58:26,649 --> 00:58:28,839
one who I ever heard

1553
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,929
say that statement and like, I 
have workshopped

1554
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:35,469
it a little bit into my own, like
how I like to phrase it, but yeah,

1555
00:58:35,499 --> 00:58:36,729
he's the inspiration for that.

1556
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:38,649
I love Doug.

1557
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:40,709
Tony Fast (he/they): That's great.

1558
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:41,829
I, Frank, you

1559
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:41,949
want

1560
00:58:41,949 --> 00:58:43,299
to take a have a look

1561
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:44,619
at Annette's comment here.

1562
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:47,739
I don't know if you want to add
any color to this about data

1563
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:51,476
spatialization. Frank Elavsky (he/him): Yeah.

1564
00:58:51,476 --> 00:58:53,344
Yup.

1565
00:58:53,394 --> 00:58:55,614
I have a blind friend who refers to datavis

1566
00:58:55,614 --> 00:58:59,034
as spatialization
because the spatial component is

1567
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,164
what he sees as distinguishing it.

1568
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:03,744
I wonder what is the difference
between spatialization and

1569
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:08,184
experiences, which is broader and
making me think, yeah, super good

1570
00:59:08,184 --> 00:59:09,342
question.

1571
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,974
I am, I come

1572
00:59:13,974 --> 00:59:16,314
from, because I come from the 
visualization community.

1573
00:59:16,314 --> 00:59:19,764
When we talk about a spatial
visualization, to me that is actually

1574
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,204
different than something that might be an

1575
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:25,334
abstract or , geometric-

1576
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:27,864
only kind of representation like 
a bar chart.

1577
00:59:28,749 --> 00:59:33,849
We wouldn't say it's spatial because
the bars don't represent real space.

1578
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:34,779
They represent

1579
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,943
abstract space.

1580
00:59:35,943 --> 00:59:37,689
And so it's

1581
00:59:37,689 --> 00:59:40,059
a symbolic representation of something 
that's

1582
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:43,419
not like out there in the world, but a
spatial visualization would be like a

1583
00:59:43,419 --> 00:59:47,709
map where the, the, the pixels or the
things you see on an X and Y coordinate

1584
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:51,519
represents something real that's out there
or some approximation of the realness.

1585
00:59:51,969 --> 00:59:56,979
So when we say spatial, that's usually
how I refer to it is that there is a.

1586
00:59:57,984 --> 01:00:00,024
There's like a real thing out
there, but you know, what's

1587
01:00:00,024 --> 01:00:01,584
interesting that I think is

1588
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:03,054
great about a blind

1589
01:00:03,054 --> 01:00:05,154
friend referring it to it as 
spatialization

1590
01:00:05,174 --> 01:00:09,624
is when you work with a tactile
interface, it becomes spatial, all

1591
01:00:09,624 --> 01:00:11,994
abstract visualizations become spatial.

1592
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:15,894
They become real things in reality
where their X and Y have like a

1593
01:00:15,894 --> 01:00:18,174
tangible meaning and existence.

1594
01:00:18,354 --> 01:00:19,824
So I think that that's fascinating.

1595
01:00:19,974 --> 01:00:23,484
I think that, you know, that's great
when I use experiences, that's my catch-

1596
01:00:23,484 --> 01:00:27,804
all for the most, the broadest way I could
possibly talk about what we do, which is

1597
01:00:27,804 --> 01:00:32,574
turning data into something. Representation
has, like data representation,

1598
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:34,104
has this assumption that

1599
01:00:34,104 --> 01:00:38,484
the data is like trying to become 
something, but

1600
01:00:38,484 --> 01:00:42,324
in experience is actually like framed
for you interacting with the thing.

1601
01:00:42,354 --> 01:00:42,654
Right.

1602
01:00:42,684 --> 01:00:44,844
And so I prefer to frame it that way.

1603
01:00:44,844 --> 01:00:49,344
Maybe it's to postmodern of me, but
when we come to data and we have some

1604
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:51,924
kind of experience, that is the space,

1605
01:00:51,984 --> 01:00:53,244
it's very human-centered

1606
01:00:53,244 --> 01:00:53,454
that I

1607
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:55,524
like to, that I like

1608
01:00:55,524 --> 01:00:57,624
to frame things around as opposed to data

1609
01:00:57,624 --> 01:01:01,704
representation, which is sort of framing
it around the data, not necessarily

1610
01:01:01,704 --> 01:01:06,184
the person first. 
Tony Fast (he/they): That was beautiful.

1611
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:09,094
Also, made me think of a tactile maps.

1612
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:09,814
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Yep.

1613
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,664
So they're the, they're the
oldest form of accessible stuff.

1614
01:01:12,694 --> 01:01:14,644
Perkins School for the
Blind has like a great

1615
01:01:14,644 --> 01:01:15,012
catalog.

1616
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:16,114
So if you

1617
01:01:16,114 --> 01:01:17,854
have a blind friend who wants to go on a

1618
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:22,534
pilgrimage to go to Perkins, they can
like check out and touch maps that

1619
01:01:22,534 --> 01:01:24,154
are like 200-something years old.

1620
01:01:25,414 --> 01:01:26,404
Tony Fast (he/they): Oh, that's so neat.

1621
01:01:26,704 --> 01:01:27,634
That's so neat. Data,

1622
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:28,654
I mean, maps are,

1623
01:01:28,654 --> 01:01:32,674
the pioneering element data
visualization effectively, right?

1624
01:01:33,034 --> 01:01:33,694
Frank Elavsky (he/him): I think so.

1625
01:01:33,754 --> 01:01:34,144
Yeah,

1626
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:34,676
absolutely.

1627
01:01:34,676 --> 01:01:35,158
Yeah.

1628
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,604
Tony Fast (he/they): So we got

1629
01:01:36,604 --> 01:01:37,564
another, we got another comment

1630
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:39,064
from Ely.

1631
01:01:39,064 --> 01:01:39,814
So,

1632
01:01:39,814 --> 01:01:40,264
we've been

1633
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:42,704
running these I made,

1634
01:01:42,754 --> 01:01:44,494
I mentioned
these earlier to you, but we've

1635
01:01:44,494 --> 01:01:45,634
been running these low code

1636
01:01:45,634 --> 01:01:49,239
workshops that bring people

1637
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:50,049
into the project, right?

1638
01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:52,869
We do acknowledge community's
important for accessibility.

1639
01:01:53,169 --> 01:01:57,489
One of the ones that's been great is we
can get people to edit RST and Markdown

1640
01:01:57,489 --> 01:01:59,889
and HTML and add some alt text to the docs.

1641
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:03,699
But we've been hard pressed to find
some other places where people can

1642
01:02:03,699 --> 01:02:04,884
come in.

1643
01:02:04,884 --> 01:02:06,069
So we're

1644
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:08,769
curious if you have any other ways 
that you

1645
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:12,939
can think about accessibility
being a door into the community.

1646
01:02:13,419 --> 01:02:13,719
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Yeah.

1647
01:02:13,749 --> 01:02:16,959
My favorite one to teach
people beyond alt text.

1648
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:20,259
And by the way, if you
want to upgrade your alt

1649
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:22,659
text game look into

1650
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:25,119
image descriptions, which is the next level.

1651
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:27,039
Alt text is a specific technology.

1652
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,459
We use to provide an image
description to something, and alt

1653
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:31,749
text is like behind the scenes.

1654
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:32,079
Right.

1655
01:02:32,409 --> 01:02:36,729
But in image description more broadly is
also visually you can see the discriptive

1656
01:02:37,464 --> 01:02:38,364
of the image.

1657
01:02:38,694 --> 01:02:39,024
And I

1658
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:40,284
think that when you

1659
01:02:40,284 --> 01:02:41,394
Frank Elavsky (he/him): look
into research by like the

1660
01:02:41,394 --> 01:02:43,614
Diagram Center their research

1661
01:02:43,614 --> 01:02:47,544
showed that providing visually a table, 
you can see as

1662
01:02:47,544 --> 01:02:49,194
well as a summary is one

1663
01:02:49,194 --> 01:02:51,084
of the best things you could do for 
accessibility, for

1664
01:02:51,084 --> 01:02:53,604
cognitive and vision-related impairments.

1665
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:58,584
So yeah, if you want to like go next
level with just  alt texts, go to

1666
01:02:58,584 --> 01:03:01,524
image descriptions, which is like
kind of broader impacts more people.

1667
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:03,534
But if you want something different to mix

1668
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:05,154
things up teach people

1669
01:03:05,154 --> 01:03:05,874
how to analyze

1670
01:03:05,874 --> 01:03:06,339
contrast.

1671
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:07,734
So you get

1672
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:10,854
a little dropper tool, you dropper on 
a color, you dropper

1673
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:12,414
on the color that surrounds it.

1674
01:03:12,624 --> 01:03:16,284
You get a little contrast
ratio, like a rating between

1675
01:03:16,284 --> 01:03:17,094
the two.

1676
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:17,904
And that's

1677
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:20,724
a great way to give people that kind 
of instinct

1678
01:03:20,754 --> 01:03:22,704
that when they look at something
they're like, Ooh, that looks a little

1679
01:03:22,704 --> 01:03:22,901
low contrast.

1680
01:03:22,901 --> 01:03:23,884
Can we bump that up?

1681
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:25,104
Because we just need more people

1682
01:03:25,104 --> 01:03:27,594
aware of that because that I

1683
01:03:27,624 --> 01:03:29,724
argue that's number two, as

1684
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:30,264
far as broad

1685
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,124
impact behind textual

1686
01:03:32,124 --> 01:03:32,364
district.

1687
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:35,899
Tony Fast (he/they): One of
the points I really loved when

1688
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:38,839
you were talking was, you know,
learn how to audit your own stuff.

1689
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:39,549
Right.

1690
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:43,509
So last year during the event

1691
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:43,599
that

1692
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:46,069
Ely ran we had breakout

1693
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:47,419
sessions where we

1694
01:03:47,419 --> 01:03:50,539
installed WAVE and

1695
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:53,449
we had conversations
around learning how to use WAVE.

1696
01:03:54,049 --> 01:03:58,279
And, you know, it was a really nice way
from like almost a top-down experience

1697
01:03:58,279 --> 01:04:00,889
there, you know, you got, we wound
up talking about color, contrast and

1698
01:04:00,889 --> 01:04:04,579
navigability, but it's kind of a really
good, like splash into getting started.

1699
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:07,069
So I'm going to just share
that WAVE extension on there.

1700
01:04:07,069 --> 01:04:08,449
I don't know if you have any

1701
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:09,559
feelings plus or

1702
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:10,249
minus on,

1703
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:11,259
on WAVE,

1704
01:04:11,259 --> 01:04:12,199
but it's

1705
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:13,939
Tony Fast (he/they): something
we've been advocating for.

1706
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:15,384
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Yeah.

1707
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:18,339
There's, my old

1708
01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:20,809
laptop actually crashed just earlier 
this week, so I'm

1709
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:22,249
using a new laptop or I'd pull up my

1710
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:22,879
extension.

1711
01:04:22,879 --> 01:04:25,399
It's , oh, I forget

1712
01:04:25,399 --> 01:04:25,909
the name of it.

1713
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,139
HTML something.

1714
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:28,969
So WAVE catches, most things.

1715
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:29,089
It's

1716
01:04:29,089 --> 01:04:30,199
pretty good.

1717
01:04:30,754 --> 01:04:31,309
I consider

1718
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:31,489
it the

1719
01:04:31,489 --> 01:04:32,722
middle ground

1720
01:04:32,722 --> 01:04:33,954
of automated

1721
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,034
Frank Elavsky (he/him): tools for the web.

1722
01:04:35,724 --> 01:04:39,174
What I think is the absolute best
is a little behind the scenes.

1723
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:43,704
So it's not as approachable for everybody,
but it's axe dev tools. Axe, dev tools.

1724
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:48,204
It runs in like you go to developer
tools and it'll be a tab there once

1725
01:04:48,204 --> 01:04:52,584
you install it without a doubt,
the best like their approach rules.

1726
01:04:52,914 --> 01:04:53,604
It's very good.

1727
01:04:53,604 --> 01:04:53,964
It's super

1728
01:04:53,964 --> 01:04:54,614
comprehensive.

1729
01:04:54,614 --> 01:04:55,914
So that's

1730
01:04:55,914 --> 01:04:56,334
at one end of

1731
01:04:56,334 --> 01:04:57,324
the spectrum, but on the

1732
01:04:57,324 --> 01:04:57,774
easy end of

1733
01:04:57,774 --> 01:04:58,884
the spectrum, and it's

1734
something that catches things that 
WAVE doesn't sometimes

1735
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,194
is I think it's HTML code checker.

1736
01:05:04,284 --> 01:05:04,854
I don't know.

1737
01:05:05,154 --> 01:05:06,894
It's old, it's really old, but

1738
01:05:06,894 --> 01:05:07,506
it's good.

1739
01:05:07,506 --> 01:05:08,424
And it also

1740
01:05:08,424 --> 01:05:10,704
has some HTML standards that WAVE

1741
01:05:10,704 --> 01:05:11,784
doesn't, isn't necessarily

1742
01:05:11,784 --> 01:05:12,528
looking for

1743
01:05:12,528 --> 01:05:13,644
and it also

1744
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:16,674
does a little better on SVG, so I 
wish I could remember

1745
01:05:16,674 --> 01:05:17,327
it.

1746
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:17,979
Sorry.

1747
01:05:17,979 --> 01:05:19,284
But yeah,

1748
01:05:19,284 --> 01:05:20,754
axe is my short answer, I guess.

1749
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:25,644
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Yeah, 
definitely, definitely agree with axe.

1750
01:05:25,654 --> 01:05:27,114
I was going to say with, I mentioned

1751
01:05:27,114 --> 01:05:28,344
earlier, we were looking into testing stuff.

1752
01:05:29,334 --> 01:05:32,364
And that has been one of the main things
we've been trying to figure out how to

1753
01:05:32,394 --> 01:05:35,094
basically put all the things together.

1754
01:05:35,124 --> 01:05:36,474
There's a lot of good resources.

1755
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,924
It's figuring out how they're going
to play nice with some of the,

1756
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:40,644
yeah,

1757
01:05:40,674 --> 01:05:41,394
Jupyter stuff.

1758
01:05:41,874 --> 01:05:41,964
Tony Fast (he/they): Yeah.

1759
01:05:41,994 --> 01:05:42,954
Well, and it's so nice.

1760
01:05:42,954 --> 01:05:46,674
The Deque labs is open source and they
have their consulting service too.

1761
01:05:46,674 --> 01:05:47,004
Right.

1762
01:05:47,004 --> 01:05:50,214
So, you know, it hits that sweet
spot of what we're all trying to

1763
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:51,129
do here.

1764
01:05:51,129 --> 01:05:52,044
So you

1765
01:05:52,044 --> 01:05:53,814
know, teaming up with other communities,

1766
01:05:53,814 --> 01:05:55,194
amplified each other's efforts.

1767
01:05:55,194 --> 01:06:00,204
Like I see writing tests as a future
opportunity, better test tools for

1768
01:06:00,204 --> 01:06:02,844
accessibility as a community opportunity.

1769
01:06:03,114 --> 01:06:03,954
Frank Elavsky (he/him):
We need that badly.

1770
01:06:03,954 --> 01:06:04,254
Right?

1771
01:06:04,254 --> 01:06:04,434
Like

1772
01:06:04,434 --> 01:06:05,664
the, the number one thing.

1773
01:06:05,664 --> 01:06:08,004
So we interviewed a lot of people 
with Chartability

1774
01:06:08,004 --> 01:06:12,984
and like pretty much every single
accessibility expert who we interviewed

1775
01:06:13,014 --> 01:06:17,934
with Chartability, about Chartability,
who tried it out, said, okay, these rule.

1776
01:06:17,934 --> 01:06:19,734
And like half of these could be automated.

1777
01:06:19,914 --> 01:06:22,314
Like we need somebody to build that stuff.

1778
01:06:22,614 --> 01:06:24,804
And so, yeah, like even
just Chartability.

1779
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:28,989
We, we could use, like, there's
a bunch of things that you could

1780
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:29,529
measure.

1781
01:06:29,529 --> 01:06:33,309
And we aren't yet. As a note

1782
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:35,139
about automated tooling, for those that

1783
01:06:35,139 --> 01:06:36,999
don't know, Deqie actually

1784
01:06:36,999 --> 01:06:40,479
did like a, an aggregate study of all 
of their audits.

1785
01:06:40,479 --> 01:06:42,339
It's just like some
enormous amount of data.

1786
01:06:42,339 --> 01:06:45,999
And they found that in general,
automated testing, even the best stuff,

1787
01:06:46,029 --> 01:06:49,179
which is theirs, found finds about two

1788
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:52,239
thirds of errors according

1789
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:53,649
to standards, right?

1790
01:06:53,769 --> 01:06:59,799
So it's about 67% of all possible things
they found using automated testing.

1791
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:03,849
And to take one thing, like imagine
a stacked bar chart, or like a tree

1792
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:05,229
map, you've got a little subset.

1793
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:05,469
Okay.

1794
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:08,259
Here's the things automated
testing can confidently find.

1795
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:14,019
That's a smaller set of all the things
that exist in standards and standards is a

1796
01:07:14,019 --> 01:07:16,419
smaller set of all possible accessibility

1797
01:07:16,419 --> 01:07:16,982
problems.

1798
01:07:16,982 --> 01:07:17,544
Right.

1799
01:07:17,544 --> 01:07:18,669
So somebody

1800
01:07:18,669 --> 01:07:20,709
did a study of just with blind people 
back in like

1801
01:07:20,709 --> 01:07:23,379
2011, Chris Power and found, I think.

1802
01:07:24,324 --> 01:07:30,414
About that WCAG addresses is about
60% of the needs of people who use screen

1803
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:32,394
readers and that's just screen reader use.

1804
01:07:32,394 --> 01:07:32,694
Right.

1805
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:34,194
So think

1806
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:35,694
of like automated

1807
01:07:35,694 --> 01:07:37,524
testing is just a little tool in your belt.

1808
01:07:37,524 --> 01:07:38,574
That's super helpful.

1809
01:07:38,574 --> 01:07:42,294
It saves you bajillions of hours of
time, but also definitely not the end game.

1810
01:07:43,914 --> 01:07:44,064
Tony Fast (he/they): Right.

1811
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:47,364
This is, this has been such
a contention with our work.

1812
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:47,694
Right.

1813
01:07:48,054 --> 01:07:50,754
Cause we've been going to a lot of
accessibility meetings and they're

1814
01:07:50,754 --> 01:07:54,114
like manual testing and it's like,
we know, we know, we know, but like

1815
01:07:54,144 --> 01:07:57,474
we're an open source project and
we're already getting some regressions

1816
01:07:57,774 --> 01:07:59,454
by not having automated testing.

1817
01:07:59,454 --> 01:07:59,724
Right.

1818
01:07:59,934 --> 01:08:05,244
So for us, like the automated testing
is also also a community contract that

1819
01:08:05,244 --> 01:08:07,764
helps us ensure that accessibility

1820
01:08:07,764 --> 01:08:09,324
stays there.

1821
01:08:09,324 --> 01:08:10,104
Gabriel

1822
01:08:10,104 --> 01:08:11,934
Tony Fast (he/they): had her,
oh yeah, go ahead, Isabela.

1823
01:08:12,024 --> 01:08:12,204
Yeah.

1824
01:08:12,294 --> 01:08:13,614
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
I was going to say, I think the

1825
01:08:13,614 --> 01:08:15,534
process is a different expectation.

1826
01:08:15,564 --> 01:08:19,314
I think that they're totally right
about accuracy, but we can't actually

1827
01:08:19,314 --> 01:08:24,354
guarantee who or when or what
is going to be reviewed or how they're

1828
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:27,804
going to review it on a open source
project has been the problem.

1829
01:08:28,254 --> 01:08:32,454
So yeah, that's, that's where I also agree
with Tony that I really think we need

1830
01:08:32,454 --> 01:08:37,664
some degree of automation just to catch
at all, but it is very tricky because

1831
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:41,229
I worry about where that
puts us at the same time.

1832
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:42,429
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Yeah.

1833
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:46,059
One of the nice things about
automation in open source communities

1834
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:52,779
is if you run a report and you
get, you know, 200 errors, some of

1835
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:54,879
them may be opportunities

1836
01:08:54,879 --> 01:08:56,579
for new contributors who are ready to go

1837
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:59,859
the next level and actually like dig
into code and fix some semantics or

1838
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:00,579
something.

1839
01:09:00,579 --> 01:09:01,299
Because

1840
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:03,639
it's not like, a lot of errors are

1841
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,979
at the rendered HTML end.

1842
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:08,799
They're not like under the hood,
you've got some logic issue

1843
01:09:08,829 --> 01:09:10,869
sometimes, but that's like

1844
01:09:10,869 --> 01:09:11,889
super approachable,

1845
01:09:11,889 --> 01:09:13,429
code-light.

1846
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:14,969
Yeah, I,

1847
01:09:14,999 --> 01:09:17,319
definitely see a really important

1848
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,059
role for automated

1849
01:09:19,059 --> 01:09:20,799
testing to play in open source.

1850
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:22,029
Tony Fast (he/they): So,

1851
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:23,559
so this this brings

1852
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:26,109
another challenge
that we're seeing with Jupyter, which

1853
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:27,369
is like a lot of these guidelines.

1854
01:09:28,194 --> 01:09:30,354
They're not for data
visualization right. They're.

1855
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:32,544
They're not for web applications.

1856
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:32,904
Right.

1857
01:09:33,114 --> 01:09:35,124
And we don't have a
normal website, you know?

1858
01:09:35,124 --> 01:09:39,804
So sometimes where we feel like
we're in uncharted territory.

1859
01:09:40,194 --> 01:09:40,434
Yes.

1860
01:09:40,434 --> 01:09:41,994
WCAG does continue to grow.

1861
01:09:42,264 --> 01:09:45,054
Hey, we get new color
contrast rules in a couple of

1862
01:09:45,054 --> 01:09:45,964
years.

1863
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:46,874
Right.

1864
01:09:46,874 --> 01:09:47,784
Yeah,

1865
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:50,094
Tony Fast (he/they): in the short term,
we might actually even have to start

1866
01:09:50,094 --> 01:09:54,984
going through, maybe even working a
little bit closer with Chartability and

1867
01:09:54,984 --> 01:09:56,544
thinking about this data experience.

1868
01:09:56,544 --> 01:09:56,784
Right.

1869
01:09:56,784 --> 01:10:00,624
Because it really be like, if
you're generating data, right.

1870
01:10:00,624 --> 01:10:04,104
Like if you walk into Jupyter and you're
like, I'm going to plot something, it's a

1871
01:10:04,104 --> 01:10:05,784
data experience that you haven't made yet.

1872
01:10:05,814 --> 01:10:06,084
Right.

1873
01:10:06,084 --> 01:10:09,444
And now you have to figure out
that whole path and journey to get

1874
01:10:09,444 --> 01:10:09,864
there.

1875
01:10:09,864 --> 01:10:11,124
And yeah, it's

1876
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,024
Tony Fast (he/they): an
interesting challenge.

1877
01:10:12,684 --> 01:10:14,784
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Let alone
can you get in the notebook in the first place.

1878
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:15,144
Like, I

1879
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,464
mean, you assumed that that

1880
01:10:16,464 --> 01:10:17,184
was possible,

1881
01:10:17,184 --> 01:10:17,544
Tony,

1882
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:18,744
that's not always the case.

1883
01:10:19,404 --> 01:10:19,434
Frank Elavsky (he/him): I

1884
01:10:19,444 --> 01:10:21,984
definitely found when I dug

1885
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,604
under the hood, one of the first things 
I looked at was.

1886
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:28,749
I think it was like selecting Python or
Python three, there was like a row of

1887
01:10:28,749 --> 01:10:31,269
square looking buttons and they are divs.

1888
01:10:31,299 --> 01:10:32,169
They are not buttons.

1889
01:10:33,369 --> 01:10:36,129
And they had like a tab index on
them and I'm like, Hmm, well, that's

1890
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:39,009
just change that to a button you're
already more accessible, but yeah.

1891
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:41,199
There's lots of little
opportunities everywhere.

1892
01:10:41,589 --> 01:10:41,859
Somebody.

1893
01:10:42,099 --> 01:10:42,249
Tony Fast (he/they): Yeah.

1894
01:10:42,249 --> 01:10:45,489
But wait, till you hear about the
head and keyboard manager underneath

1895
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:47,049
of the whole thing. Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): 
I don't think we have,

1896
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:52,119
there are some short, there are some

1897
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:53,713
small wins.

1898
01:10:53,713 --> 01:10:54,509
And,

1899
01:10:54,519 --> 01:10:55,629
Tony Fast (he/they): you know,
one of the things that you

1900
01:10:55,629 --> 01:10:57,159
mentioned was making the problems smaller.

1901
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:02,229
The cool thing about Jupyter is that it's
evolved into this pluggable ecosystem.

1902
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,079
Everything's an extension, right?

1903
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:04,389
Right.

1904
01:11:04,629 --> 01:11:09,629
So now we're able to focus on a more
paired down version of the newest Jupyter,

1905
01:11:09,629 --> 01:11:11,019
which is just the notebook experience.

1906
01:11:11,019 --> 01:11:11,229
Right.

1907
01:11:11,349 --> 01:11:14,869
You can actually take the same components
that we're building in JupyterLab,

1908
01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:19,869
improve JupyterLab's, accessibility, and
a simpler experience at the same time.

1909
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:24,009
So we're starting to run into like the
super modular components and access

1910
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:26,499
they're already internationalized, right?

1911
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:30,399
So we have multiple languages and
coverage and multiple languages.

1912
01:11:30,609 --> 01:11:36,189
So now we have to go and do a
multi-lingual alt text and we have to

1913
01:11:36,189 --> 01:11:40,479
start making sure that this experience
is inclusive across nationalities too.

1914
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,429
Frank Elavsky (he/him):  Yeah, I, I wanted

1915
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:44,759
to say

1916
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,859
that on.

1917
01:11:46,859 --> 01:11:48,959
So yeah,

1918
01:11:48,959 --> 01:11:50,429
that brings up a bunch of thoughts that

1919
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:53,039
I have, but also other thoughts.

1920
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:55,129
Oh, are we at time or.

1921
01:11:56,064 --> 01:11:59,004
I want to be respectful of everybody
here actually, before I keep

1922
01:11:59,004 --> 01:12:01,344
talking, what were we going to?

1923
01:12:01,344 --> 01:12:02,064
45,000.

1924
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:03,474
Tony Fast (he/they): We're good.

1925
01:12:03,534 --> 01:12:06,864
Let's just, let's, let's continue
a conversation as long as possible,

1926
01:12:07,194 --> 01:12:12,234
or as long as you're up until like
about 10 or so, or the hour up into

1927
01:12:12,234 --> 01:12:12,939
the hour.

1928
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:13,644
, and then

1929
01:12:13,644 --> 01:12:16,884
Tony Fast (he/they): we'll switch into
the breakout rooms and just spend the rest

1930
01:12:16,884 --> 01:12:18,354
of the time talking with the audience.

1931
01:12:18,594 --> 01:12:18,984
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Yay.

1932
01:12:19,014 --> 01:12:19,644
Okay, cool.

1933
01:12:19,644 --> 01:12:20,544
So I want him to

1934
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:22,104
say that first off,

1935
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:25,854
I love that both of you, Tony and Gabriel 
have used

1936
01:12:25,854 --> 01:12:30,534
the phrase uncharted territory because
I it's very corny and I love it so much

1937
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:31,674
because that's where we're at, right?

1938
01:12:31,674 --> 01:12:35,424
Like where, when you get into
accessible data experiences, it's

1939
01:12:35,424 --> 01:12:37,644
like it's uncharted space, right.

1940
01:12:38,124 --> 01:12:39,564
In both, both senses of

1941
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:40,428
the word.

1942
And on the

1943
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,194
note about what

1944
01:12:43,194 --> 01:12:46,854
keg and I, I really,

1945
01:12:46,854 --> 01:12:49,074
really, really hope to frame standards in

1946
01:12:49,074 --> 01:12:51,834
the right way to folks, because
for me, this was difficult.

1947
01:12:53,034 --> 01:12:57,384
As, as a way of thinking about what
standards are for, I didn't really

1948
01:12:57,384 --> 01:12:59,124
realize it at first, but standards are a

1949
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,834
political document. Standards

1950
01:13:01,884 --> 01:13:05,934
like, and that shapes how we should approach 
them, right.

1951
01:13:06,114 --> 01:13:07,434
Standards are developed.

1952
01:13:07,464 --> 01:13:12,774
They are developed and adopted with
like political bodies influencing them.

1953
01:13:12,804 --> 01:13:13,164
Right?

1954
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:17,124
So like the only reason standards
got adopted is because I think

1955
01:13:17,124 --> 01:13:18,354
there was early negotiations.

1956
01:13:18,354 --> 01:13:22,014
I think Japan really did a lot
of pushback against the U.S.

1957
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:24,234
And then there were some
European players involved.

1958
01:13:24,624 --> 01:13:29,184
And so it became, standards are a
body of consensus before they are an

1959
01:13:29,184 --> 01:13:31,554
effective way of building accessibility.

1960
01:13:31,554 --> 01:13:31,884
Right?

1961
01:13:32,434 --> 01:13:34,584
Like the number one thing

1962
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:36,654
you need to keep in mind is that standards

1963
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:41,994
will never be fully sufficient
for creating accessible stuff.

1964
01:13:42,264 --> 01:13:46,964
It is simply a very good starting
point to bring people together for.

1965
01:13:47,709 --> 01:13:51,609
Talking about the same thing, because
otherwise it's just this nightmarish

1966
01:13:51,609 --> 01:13:55,119
mass of like, we don't know how to
measure things together and whatever.

1967
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:58,449
So as long as you keep that in
mind about standards, that it's a

1968
01:13:58,449 --> 01:13:59,769
political document built

1969
01:13:59,769 --> 01:13:59,889
on

1970
01:13:59,889 --> 01:14:02,709
consensus that you know,

1971
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:05,619
the real real quest for accessibility 
is actually far

1972
01:14:05,619 --> 01:14:07,104
beyond that,

1973
01:14:07,104 --> 01:14:08,589
then you're

1974
01:14:08,589 --> 01:14:08,919
good.

1975
01:14:09,099 --> 01:14:15,279
And I also like to preface, like following
standards or meeting compliance is an

1976
01:14:15,309 --> 01:14:17,409
exercise in avoiding getting sued.

1977
01:14:17,979 --> 01:14:21,429
It's not an exercise in providing
a good accessible experience.

1978
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:23,049
It's just a one step along the way.

1979
01:14:23,049 --> 01:14:23,349
Right.

1980
01:14:23,349 --> 01:14:29,109
It's just like trying to mitigate your
risk of like, you know, getting sued.

1981
01:14:29,139 --> 01:14:30,099
That's really the goal

1982
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:30,903
it serves.

1983
01:14:30,903 --> 01:14:32,109
And if you

1984
01:14:32,109 --> 01:14:34,719
really want to do a good job of like actually

1985
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:36,099
making an inclusive community

1986
01:14:36,129 --> 01:14:37,629
then yeah,

1987
01:14:37,629 --> 01:14:38,379
you're

1988
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:39,849
going to have to go beyond standards.

1989
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:40,149
And I

1990
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:43,299
think that something

1991
01:14:43,299 --> 01:14:46,149
that is woefully under-discussed.

1992
01:14:46,914 --> 01:14:51,894
That is perhaps from my perspective,
the most hopeful thing about Jupyter is

1993
01:14:51,894 --> 01:14:56,274
what has already been mentioned, which
is that it's, it's within a modular

1994
01:14:56,274 --> 01:14:56,978
ecosystem.

1995
01:14:56,978 --> 01:15:01,905
And back in the day 12, 10,

1996
01:15:01,905 --> 01:15:02,634
12 years

1997
01:15:02,634 --> 01:15:04,524
ago now some really

1998
01:15:04,524 --> 01:15:08,334
great papers started to come out at 
the intersection

1999
01:15:08,334 --> 01:15:11,694
of disability studies and assistive
technology where people started

2000
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:15,354
to talk about what does it mean to
build communities where people can

2001
01:15:15,354 --> 01:15:20,724
self-advocate or where
people can, have

2002
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:20,874
the

2003
01:15:20,874 --> 01:15:24,084
power to DIY their

2004
01:15:24,084 --> 01:15:25,734
own accessibility in real life.

2005
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:29,934
We, people who are disabled,
we will often modularize our

2006
01:15:29,934 --> 01:15:31,174
own house.

2007
01:15:31,174 --> 01:15:31,794
Especially

2008
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:32,694
if we have mobility

2009
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,934
or like you know a physical

2010
01:15:35,934 --> 01:15:39,054
disability, we improve the world around 
us, but our

2011
01:15:39,054 --> 01:15:41,574
technical systems are really surprisingly

2012
01:15:41,574 --> 01:15:42,499
inflexible.

2013
01:15:42,499 --> 01:15:44,349
Which they

2014
01:15:44,349 --> 01:15:45,009
shouldn't be, right.

2015
01:15:45,009 --> 01:15:48,909
It actually should be the opposite
digital and, and, and virtual

2016
01:15:49,329 --> 01:15:53,589
environments should be extremely
malleable to the user's needs.

2017
01:15:54,009 --> 01:15:59,679
And we are seeing, I think I like
to believe the beginning of this new

2018
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:04,719
era of, of a time when people can,
and we see this in notebooks, right?

2019
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:07,179
You pick how you want to visualize
you, pick how you want to manage

2020
01:16:07,179 --> 01:16:09,819
your data, how you want to clean your
data, how you want to get it from

2021
01:16:10,029 --> 01:16:12,279
some wild server into your notebook.

2022
01:16:12,309 --> 01:16:17,229
Like all of that stuff is a choose
your own adventure type of experience.

2023
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:23,649
And this is like, this is the most
interesting space for accessibility to

2024
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:29,109
arise, and it is more important in my
opinion, to get out of people's way and to

2025
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:35,199
to break down your barriers in how you
allow a modular community to do its thing

2026
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:37,899
than it is about trying to actually solve.

2027
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:43,899
Making everything high contrast, which
you really should aspire to do is how can

2028
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,829
we enable people to build the coolest,
possible shit that they can bring in.

2029
01:16:47,859 --> 01:16:48,189
Right.

2030
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:49,269
That, that's

2031
01:16:49,269 --> 01:16:49,817
interesting.

2032
01:16:49,817 --> 01:16:51,459
And yeah, I'm

2033
01:16:51,459 --> 01:16:52,569
just really hopeful for that.

2034
01:16:52,599 --> 01:16:52,869
Sorry.

2035
01:16:52,869 --> 01:16:55,959
I ranted for like five minutes on
this, but it's very exciting to me.

2036
01:16:57,909 --> 01:16:58,659
Tony Fast (he/they): That was great.

2037
01:16:58,659 --> 01:17:02,289
I mean, like in a lot of ways,
accessibility is one of the last

2038
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:03,729
things to fall in line with Jupyter.

2039
01:17:04,029 --> 01:17:07,689
It's a project built on open
standards and open protocols, right?

2040
01:17:07,959 --> 01:17:12,099
And we've been adding and adding
standards and protocols to the

2041
01:17:12,099 --> 01:17:13,659
ecosystem for a really long time.

2042
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:16,029
And accessibility is one of the last ones,

2043
01:17:16,369 --> 01:17:17,549
you know?

2044
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:18,729
And for

2045
01:17:18,729 --> 01:17:22,659
me, I personally
identify, like, I love telling

2046
01:17:22,659 --> 01:17:23,889
stories with Jupyter notebooks.

2047
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:27,459
Like I implicitly have communication
challenges as a neurodiverse person.

2048
01:17:28,139 --> 01:17:31,914
Jupyter notebooks to me
often appear as a cognitive

2049
01:17:31,914 --> 01:17:33,744
accessibility tool like implicitly.

2050
01:17:33,744 --> 01:17:37,884
I see the notebook as an accessibility
tool for telling stories that I

2051
01:17:37,884 --> 01:17:39,384
wouldn't have been able to communicate

2052
01:17:39,384 --> 01:17:40,494
otherwise.

2053
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:41,604
And,

2054
01:17:41,604 --> 01:17:44,214
yeah, it's fantastic for me, for those reasons.

2055
01:17:45,354 --> 01:17:46,104
Frank Elavsky (he/him): Mars had something

2056
01:17:46,104 --> 01:17:51,008
interesting to say can I jump on this?

2057
01:17:51,008 --> 01:17:51,621
Okay.

2058
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:52,234
Okay,

2059
01:17:52,284 --> 01:17:54,384
How do you advocate for cultural shift to

2060
01:17:54,384 --> 01:17:57,504
accessibility in a decentralized
space such as open source?

2061
01:17:57,654 --> 01:17:58,194
Yes.

2062
01:17:58,224 --> 01:17:59,124
This is a very good

2063
01:17:59,124 --> 01:17:59,734
question.

2064
01:17:59,734 --> 01:18:00,954
If, for

2065
01:18:00,954 --> 01:18:01,524
example, needing

2066
01:18:01,524 --> 01:18:03,924
approval from some

2067
01:18:03,924 --> 01:18:06,624
other, for a grant to hire people 
with disabilities,

2068
01:18:06,804 --> 01:18:09,594
I feel like there's still some
cultural resistance that technology is

2069
01:18:09,594 --> 01:18:12,324
neutral or against,

2070
01:18:12,324 --> 01:18:12,684
Oops, sorry,

2071
01:18:12,684 --> 01:18:14,444
chat moved.

2072
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:16,204
Or against,

2073
01:18:16,254 --> 01:18:16,824
oh, sorry.

2074
01:18:16,824 --> 01:18:17,634
I lost my space.

2075
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:20,724
Or against bringing cultural war.

2076
01:18:20,754 --> 01:18:21,054
Yeah.

2077
01:18:21,084 --> 01:18:23,484
Centralized spaces, such as
companies or governments can

2078
01:18:23,484 --> 01:18:27,954
implement top-down policies, the
de-centralized spaces by nature.

2079
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:28,704
Can't do that.

2080
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:32,004
And this is exactly why I'm
glad you asked, because now

2081
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:33,114
I can just say it straight.

2082
01:18:33,654 --> 01:18:38,484
This is why I brought in community
organizing as a, just a little hint

2083
01:18:38,484 --> 01:18:39,744
that I gave earlier in my talk.

2084
01:18:39,744 --> 01:18:42,114
You all should, I don't
want to add to the pressure.

2085
01:18:42,114 --> 01:18:44,034
You're all going to be learning
a lot of new things and doing new

2086
01:18:44,034 --> 01:18:48,414
things, but your job is to become
organizers in a decentralized space.

2087
01:18:48,414 --> 01:18:49,734
How do you get a community together to

2088
01:18:49,734 --> 01:18:51,964
fight a slumlord? You organize.

2089
01:18:52,014 --> 01:18:53,874
and you can't rely on the police.

2090
01:18:53,874 --> 01:18:55,254
You can't rely on the mayor or whatever.

2091
01:18:55,254 --> 01:18:56,244
They might be helpful.

2092
01:18:56,424 --> 01:19:01,644
Centralized systems are still helpful
when you're in a decentralized like micro

2093
01:19:01,644 --> 01:19:02,994
ecosystem, right?

2094
01:19:02,994 --> 01:19:04,344
You can

2095
01:19:04,344 --> 01:19:06,774
partner with these big things and 
sometimes they

2096
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:11,394
can do things for you, muscle things
around, but when you're on the ground

2097
01:19:11,574 --> 01:19:14,634
and you're working in a pretty flat space

2098
01:19:14,944 --> 01:19:15,891
organized.

2099
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:17,784
And yeah,

2100
01:19:17,784 --> 01:19:21,594
organizers have a long and rich history of like

2101
01:19:21,594 --> 01:19:24,534
doing some pretty cool things that
I think open-source communities can

2102
01:19:24,534 --> 01:19:25,534
learn from.

2103
Because

2104
01:19:26,034 --> 01:19:27,984
one of, you know, for example, one of 
the things you

2105
01:19:27,984 --> 01:19:29,994
can do is you know,

2106
01:19:29,994 --> 01:19:32,064
there's cultural resistance that technology is

2107
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:32,884
neutral.

2108
01:19:32,884 --> 01:19:34,524
In organizing,

2109
01:19:34,524 --> 01:19:36,504
you know, you generally will try

2110
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:38,064
to avoid philosophical debates.

2111
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:38,364
Right?

2112
01:19:38,394 --> 01:19:40,554
You'll bring people together
on like, we care about, I care

2113
01:19:40,554 --> 01:19:41,484
about this, you care about this.

2114
01:19:41,484 --> 01:19:41,784
Right.

2115
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:42,564
Okay, good.

2116
01:19:42,564 --> 01:19:45,474
Now that we agree it
let's do it like, and the

2117
01:19:45,474 --> 01:19:48,244
debate is you know,

2118
01:19:48,294 --> 01:19:50,184
whether intentionally or not, it's one of the

2119
01:19:50,184 --> 01:19:52,104
things that, that really slows down.

2120
01:19:53,629 --> 01:19:57,889
And being really action oriented
in a decentralized system is

2121
01:19:57,889 --> 01:19:58,599
important.

2122
01:19:58,599 --> 01:20:00,019
And there's

2123
01:20:00,019 --> 01:20:02,869
a space for philosophy and then 
there's a space

2124
01:20:02,869 --> 01:20:06,709
for deeper discussion and it needs to
happen, but it needs to happen in what

2125
01:20:06,709 --> 01:20:11,209
you might call a caucus or a breakout
group of people who you've designated

2126
01:20:11,209 --> 01:20:14,359
this as a really safe space to kind
of figure out what we believe in.

2127
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:17,689
And then we go to the
larger community with

2128
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:18,973
just action.

2129
01:20:18,973 --> 01:20:20,899
And it takes

2130
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:21,649
a lot of work.

2131
01:20:21,769 --> 01:20:24,319
I, I burnt out from community
organizing years ago.

2132
01:20:24,499 --> 01:20:25,129
That's why I'm not

2133
01:20:25,129 --> 01:20:26,083
doing it.

2134
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,989
It is very tiring,

2135
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,419
but I learned

2136
01:20:29,419 --> 01:20:30,289
a lot of lessons from

2137
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:31,594
that space.

2138
01:20:31,594 --> 01:20:32,247
Okay,

2139
01:20:32,247 --> 01:20:32,899
Mars,

2140
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:34,069
continuing uncomfortable

2141
01:20:34,069 --> 01:20:35,209
talking about advocacy, justice

2142
01:20:35,209 --> 01:20:37,099
access and humanities spaces.

2143
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:37,489
Yeah.

2144
01:20:37,519 --> 01:20:37,609
I

2145
01:20:37,609 --> 01:20:38,532
love the humanities.

2146
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:38,839
I

2147
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:39,229
worked in

2148
01:20:39,229 --> 01:20:40,369
digital humanities before

2149
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:42,139
I got a job in tech.

2150
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:43,399
It's my

2151
01:20:43,399 --> 01:20:44,374
undergrad stuff.

2152
01:20:44,862 --> 01:20:45,349
I think

2153
01:20:45,349 --> 01:20:47,059
in some ways, decentralized is also a benefit.

2154
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:51,024
Over centralized in
terms of changing things.

2155
01:20:51,024 --> 01:20:51,954
Centralization.

2156
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:52,404
Yeah.

2157
01:20:52,434 --> 01:20:53,544
Lots of bureaucracy.

2158
01:20:53,664 --> 01:20:54,444
You gotta be lucky.

2159
01:20:54,744 --> 01:20:55,704
I was lucky at Visa.

2160
01:20:56,004 --> 01:20:56,784
Just top down.

2161
01:20:57,084 --> 01:20:57,864
Nobody fought me.

2162
01:20:58,224 --> 01:20:59,034
I was like, let's do this.

2163
01:20:59,034 --> 01:20:59,724
They're like, okay.

2164
01:20:59,964 --> 01:21:00,804
It's part of the mission.

2165
01:21:00,954 --> 01:21:01,284
Sure.

2166
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:02,184
Stamp, stamp, stamp,

2167
01:21:02,184 --> 01:21:03,654
stamp go.

2168
01:21:03,654 --> 01:21:05,859
That's very rare.

2169
01:21:05,859 --> 01:21:06,594
Right.

2170
01:21:06,594 --> 01:21:08,064
One centralized

2171
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,324
groups reached critical mass.

2172
01:21:09,354 --> 01:21:10,374
It can be easier to push forward.

2173
01:21:10,374 --> 01:21:10,584
Yeah.

2174
01:21:10,584 --> 01:21:11,634
That's exactly what

2175
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:12,494
happened.

2176
01:21:12,494 --> 01:21:13,354
Yeah.

2177
01:21:13,354 --> 01:21:14,214
Okay.

2178
01:21:14,214 --> 01:21:15,384
Larger discussion on this.

2179
01:21:15,594 --> 01:21:16,464
We have three minutes.

2180
01:21:16,674 --> 01:21:18,114
Anybody else have comments or anything?

2181
01:21:21,854 --> 01:21:23,744
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): I do
think Rose's comment is interesting

2182
01:21:23,744 --> 01:21:26,864
because spending all my time in a
de-centralized space does not feel

2183
01:21:26,864 --> 01:21:28,934
like it is faster action oriented.

2184
01:21:29,234 --> 01:21:32,504
Although I see why it could
seem that way, but go ahead.

2185
01:21:34,814 --> 01:21:36,824
Tony Fast (he/they): Sometimes the
open source feels like a parade.

2186
01:21:37,869 --> 01:21:40,269
And I'm on the side of it, right.

2187
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:42,759
Where it's like, there are only
certain people who can float

2188
01:21:43,089 --> 01:21:44,649
some of these things, you know?

2189
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:49,329
So yeah, it really is a cha I mean,
it's not even just like a decentralized

2190
01:21:49,329 --> 01:21:53,019
system, like in the Jupyter, we're
starting to see larger organizations

2191
01:21:53,019 --> 01:21:54,429
gather around the project too.

2192
01:21:54,729 --> 01:21:58,929
So it's almost like a decentralized
in pseudo centralized philosophies

2193
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:00,396
interfering.

2194
01:22:00,396 --> 01:22:01,253
Right.

2195
01:22:01,253 --> 01:22:02,109
And

2196
01:22:02,109 --> 01:22:03,729
I mean, after hearing you talk to you, I just

2197
01:22:03,729 --> 01:22:05,049
want to go start a coup somewhere.

2198
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:08,769
I don't even know where, but like, I'm
just like to go organize something.

2199
01:22:09,129 --> 01:22:11,749
Oh no, look, it's tear
down a stop sign somewhere.

2200
01:22:13,989 --> 01:22:16,389
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
Like, just I'd love if you turn that

2201
01:22:16,389 --> 01:22:21,789
energy into people, getting some
code in on, to be honest with you.

2202
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:26,079
Frank Elavsky (he/him): The thing
that I think entices people about

2203
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:30,579
organizing is overthrowing systems of
power, but it turns out that that's a

2204
01:22:30,579 --> 01:22:34,269
very small piece, largely organizing
you, go and knock on someone's door.

2205
01:22:34,269 --> 01:22:35,829
You check out, you learn your neighbor's name.

2206
01:22:36,609 --> 01:22:37,449
You learn what their care

2207
01:22:37,449 --> 01:22:38,799
about.

2208
You connect

2209
01:22:40,149 --> 01:22:42,699
with them and you're doing almost

2210
01:22:42,699 --> 01:22:43,839
no work for a very long time.

2211
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:44,919
It doesn't feel like work, right.

2212
01:22:44,949 --> 01:22:45,639
It's a different kind

2213
01:22:45,639 --> 01:22:46,329
of work.

2214
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:47,019
And then

2215
01:22:47,019 --> 01:22:49,899
eventually when you reach a critical mass 
of people and

2216
01:22:49,899 --> 01:22:54,309
you all know, they care about the same
thing you do, then boom, you can do an

2217
01:22:54,309 --> 01:22:54,744
action.

2218
01:22:54,744 --> 01:22:56,049
And if you've

2219
01:22:56,049 --> 01:22:58,149
strategized correctly, you can do pretty

2220
01:22:58,149 --> 01:23:00,239
amazing things.

2221
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:02,329
So yeah,

2222
01:23:02,379 --> 01:23:02,919
Frank Elavsky (he/him): let's go,

2223
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:05,019
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
I'm really enjoying the turn.

2224
01:23:05,019 --> 01:23:05,769
This has taken.

2225
01:23:05,769 --> 01:23:06,069
This is not where I expected to go today.

2226
01:23:13,809 --> 01:23:14,319
Frank Elavsky (he/him): The best talk I've ever 
given today for sure.

2227
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:15,609
I love it with this way.

2228
01:23:15,639 --> 01:23:15,909
Tony Fast (he/him): Yeah.

2229
01:23:16,959 --> 01:23:19,539
Mars' picket signs are
going to be the best and I

2230
01:23:19,539 --> 01:23:20,409
promise you they're going to be

2231
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:22,749
the most accessible, like on her blog posts.

2232
01:23:22,809 --> 01:23:25,989
Like people are like, these are
the most accessible images, so I

2233
01:23:25,989 --> 01:23:27,669
can't wait to see how she protests.

2234
01:23:28,299 --> 01:23:28,899
Frank Elavsky (he/him): That's awesome.

2235
01:23:28,929 --> 01:23:29,664
Yeah.

2236
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:34,074
There's , there's a whole And I'd

2237
01:23:34,074 --> 01:23:35,874
love to remain part of that discussion

2238
01:23:35,874 --> 01:23:39,534
too, just to be an ear or a fly on
the wall if you will, but there's

2239
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:44,484
a whole unexplored, and by unexplored,

2240
01:23:44,484 --> 01:23:45,984
Frank Elavsky (he/him): I don't
mean theoretically people would talk

2241
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:49,974
about this in papers and whatnot, but
there are, there are problems when

2242
01:23:49,974 --> 01:23:54,384
it comes to picketing or advocating
in digital spaces, because there

2243
01:23:54,384 --> 01:23:56,964
actually is a, a really

2244
01:23:56,964 --> 01:24:01,164
immovable inflexible nature, 
by which, by how

2245
01:24:01,164 --> 01:24:04,314
we've designed, you go to a website,
you can't like protest the website

2246
01:24:04,314 --> 01:24:05,304
in the same way that you could.

2247
01:24:05,304 --> 01:24:09,084
If you stand outside a building
and say, stop, whatever.

2248
01:24:09,114 --> 01:24:09,474
Right.

2249
01:24:09,864 --> 01:24:15,264
And so we lose our physical
embodied agency in digital spaces.

2250
01:24:15,264 --> 01:24:18,924
And there's this really interesting
thing that happens then in how we

2251
01:24:18,924 --> 01:24:20,164
organize.

2252
01:24:20,164 --> 01:24:22,644
Yeah, let's

2253
01:24:22,644 --> 01:24:22,914
go.

2254
01:24:23,004 --> 01:24:23,394
Okay.

2255
01:24:23,454 --> 01:24:25,104
So anyway, I'm reading chat again.

2256
01:24:26,424 --> 01:24:26,694
Yeah.

2257
01:24:26,724 --> 01:24:30,414
I just hope to leave you all with a
sense of passion, that there's tons of

2258
01:24:30,414 --> 01:24:32,184
things that different people could do.

2259
01:24:32,244 --> 01:24:34,674
If you're interested, you
don't have to write code.

2260
01:24:34,704 --> 01:24:37,014
There's a huge space for
just connecting with people.

2261
01:24:37,494 --> 01:24:41,934
You need to connect and organize and
congeal around actions you want to take.

2262
01:24:42,234 --> 01:24:44,544
And then, you know, you just
want to write code and have

2263
01:24:44,544 --> 01:24:45,354
somebody tell you what to do.

2264
01:24:45,354 --> 01:24:48,804
And you kind of live in a little like
dungeon box there's roles for those

2265
01:24:48,804 --> 01:24:49,974
people too.

2266
01:24:49,974 --> 01:24:51,144
Yeah, everybody

2267
01:24:51,144 --> 01:24:51,324
has

2268
01:24:51,324 --> 01:24:52,404
a space.

2269
01:24:52,404 --> 01:24:53,484
And thanks.

2270
01:24:53,484 --> 01:24:54,114
Thanks for having me.

2271
01:24:54,114 --> 01:24:57,504
This was an enormous
amount of fun, super glad.

2272
01:24:58,854 --> 01:24:59,574
Tony Fast (he/they): That's awesome.

2273
01:24:59,604 --> 01:25:00,324
Thank you for being

2274
01:25:00,324 --> 01:25:02,094
here for that was

2275
01:25:02,094 --> 01:25:04,254
Tony Fast (he/they): really informative
and you know, we're going to have

2276
01:25:04,254 --> 01:25:05,634
more of these events in the future.

2277
01:25:05,904 --> 01:25:06,744
We'll let you know about

2278
01:25:06,744 --> 01:25:08,304
them and maybe, you

2279
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:11,274
know, send out some invites to your

2280
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:14,094
colleagues and let's, let's start
getting a crew together, right?

2281
01:25:14,094 --> 01:25:16,104
Like organization happens
with a massive amount

2282
01:25:16,104 --> 01:25:17,404
of people.

2283
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,054
And,

2284
01:25:18,054 --> 01:25:19,554
Yeah, it seems like we're all angry in the

2285
01:25:19,554 --> 01:25:20,914
same direction, so let's keep.

2286
01:25:22,799 --> 01:25:23,189
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Right.

2287
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:25,889
And I would also say, thank you
for, I know Tony said, thank

2288
01:25:25,889 --> 01:25:27,109
you, but really thank you.

2289
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:31,739
I, I hope that, you know,
you have very rare expertise.

2290
01:25:31,739 --> 01:25:36,299
And so I was really happy that you were,
that you were willing to come speak with

2291
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:40,709
us since there's not a lot of people
that I've run into at least doing this.

2292
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:43,979
So I'm super grateful and many
people in the community have asked

2293
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:46,679
for a lot of answers to a lot of
questions you discussed today.

2294
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:49,409
So I think even people who
can't be here, we'll be super

2295
01:25:49,409 --> 01:25:50,909
happy to have these resources.

2296
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:51,569
Cool.

2297
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:52,319
Thank you.

2298
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:52,919
Thanks so much.

2299
01:25:53,559 --> 01:25:54,539
Tony Fast (he/they):
I also want to credit.

2300
01:25:55,794 --> 01:25:59,244
He did very good crowd work today,
which is hard to do in these digital spaces.

2301
01:26:00,714 --> 01:26:02,514
Kudos to you, kudos to you.

2302
01:26:03,624 --> 01:26:03,774
All

2303
01:26:03,774 --> 01:26:04,444
right.

2304
01:26:04,444 --> 01:26:05,784
Well Isabela,

2305
01:26:05,784 --> 01:26:06,804
Do we need to share this?

2306
01:26:06,864 --> 01:26:09,504
So Frank, where we can probably throw you

2307
01:26:09,504 --> 01:26:10,164
off stage?

2308
01:26:10,494 --> 01:26:10,824
I don't

2309
01:26:10,824 --> 01:26:11,754
know if somebody can do that.

2310
01:26:12,474 --> 01:26:13,434
Let me get the bucket.

2311
01:26:17,814 --> 01:26:18,144
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Oh my

2312
01:26:18,144 --> 01:26:19,692
gosh, Tony.

2313
01:26:19,692 --> 01:26:22,014
Tony Fast (he/they): So do we

2314
01:26:22,014 --> 01:26:24,314
need to show our presentation now, Isabela?

2315
01:26:24,414 --> 01:26:24,834
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Yes.

2316
01:26:24,834 --> 01:26:26,094
Let me get that back up for you.

2317
01:26:26,094 --> 01:26:27,834
And you can talk if that's okay.

2318
01:26:28,524 --> 01:26:29,484
Tony Fast (he/they): That was so good.

2319
01:26:30,054 --> 01:26:31,554
I was I'm so happy.

2320
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:32,814
We finally got to see that

2321
01:26:33,864 --> 01:26:36,024
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
I have been waiting anxiously.

2322
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:36,624
Okay.

2323
01:26:36,654 --> 01:26:38,394
Sharing in tire.

2324
01:26:38,604 --> 01:26:40,374
It's going to be a moment of awkward.

2325
01:26:40,374 --> 01:26:42,204
And then a moment of here we are.

2326
01:26:44,394 --> 01:26:45,294
I had it for me.

2327
01:26:45,294 --> 01:26:47,184
So I remembered once you stop.

2328
01:26:47,754 --> 01:26:48,744
Tony Fast (he/they): Oh, nice.

2329
01:26:48,774 --> 01:26:49,352
Nice.

2330
01:26:49,352 --> 01:26:51,084
So let's see

2331
01:26:51,084 --> 01:26:53,544
Tony Fast (he/they): how many
folks are hanging around here?

2332
01:26:53,544 --> 01:26:54,504
We had 10 folks.

2333
01:26:54,924 --> 01:26:58,584
Would we think we just do like one
breakout room or two breakout rooms?

2334
01:26:59,724 --> 01:27:01,254
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
It depends if you want

2335
01:27:01,254 --> 01:27:02,154
everyone to talk to you today.

2336
01:27:02,174 --> 01:27:05,634
I think 10, 10 could be a lot of
people to talk over each other.

2337
01:27:05,634 --> 01:27:07,134
So maybe we should just do two.

2338
01:27:07,134 --> 01:27:09,354
So people have lots of
opportunities to speak.

2339
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:13,944
If they want to speak, you don't have to,
just to be clear, you don't have to speak.

2340
01:27:13,944 --> 01:27:16,704
You don't have to turn camera on
whatever it prompts you to do.

2341
01:27:17,424 --> 01:27:17,544
Tony Fast (he/they): That's

2342
01:27:17,544 --> 01:27:18,324
super cool.

2343
01:27:18,324 --> 01:27:20,274
Can you do me a favor

2344
01:27:20,274 --> 01:27:20,754
and share the

2345
01:27:20,754 --> 01:27:22,274
notes document in there?

2346
01:27:22,274 --> 01:27:23,034
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): When I'm

2347
01:27:23,034 --> 01:27:24,114
not sharing my screen.

2348
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:25,284
Tony Fast (he/they): Okay.

2349
01:27:25,284 --> 01:27:25,494
Yeah.

2350
01:27:25,524 --> 01:27:26,724
Good point.

2351
01:27:26,724 --> 01:27:27,924
What was

2352
01:27:27,924 --> 01:27:28,704
Tony Fast (he/they): it
we're going to talk about?

2353
01:27:29,664 --> 01:27:30,774
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
Oh, that's the next slide.

2354
01:27:31,014 --> 01:27:32,004
Okay, so we have two

2355
01:27:32,004 --> 01:27:32,477
prompts.

2356
01:27:32,477 --> 01:27:33,894
And of course,

2357
01:27:33,894 --> 01:27:35,484
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): if you
have other things you want to discuss,

2358
01:27:35,484 --> 01:27:37,464
that's open too, but so we want to.

2359
01:27:38,244 --> 01:27:41,304
How would you have done past
work differently if you already

2360
01:27:41,304 --> 01:27:44,214
knew whatever you learned today,
that kind of introspection

2361
01:27:44,214 --> 01:27:46,314
reflection, thinking

2362
01:27:46,314 --> 01:27:48,084
about those choices can really help you figure

2363
01:27:48,084 --> 01:27:49,794
out what you want to do in the future.

2364
01:27:50,424 --> 01:27:52,734
And also just what new
questions do you have?

2365
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:53,964
What more do you want to learn?

2366
01:27:54,054 --> 01:27:55,614
I've always found it really helpful.

2367
01:27:55,614 --> 01:28:01,014
Identifying what, you know, at least for
me, I never stopped having more questions.

2368
01:28:01,044 --> 01:28:03,204
So it's kind of like, what
do I want to research next?

2369
01:28:03,204 --> 01:28:07,374
Cause you may be in a room with someone
who has an answer to that and we can

2370
01:28:07,374 --> 01:28:08,994
already start connecting them together.

2371
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:10,914
And just so you know, once I share the

2372
01:28:10,914 --> 01:28:11,874
notes document, these

2373
01:28:11,874 --> 01:28:13,704
questions are listed in there as well.

2374
01:28:13,704 --> 01:28:17,514
So you don't have to
remember them going to one

2375
01:28:17,514 --> 01:28:18,519
breakout rooms.

2376
01:28:18,519 --> 01:28:20,529
Frederic had to go.

2377
01:28:20,529 --> 01:28:21,534
Let's just

2378
01:28:21,534 --> 01:28:23,344
Do, we're gonna Tania.

2379
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:24,804
We'll just start one breakout

2380
01:28:24,804 --> 01:28:25,457
room.

2381
01:28:25,457 --> 01:28:27,414
And , we'll all

2382
01:28:27,414 --> 01:28:29,674
be here to
answer any questions and we'll.

2383
01:28:30,474 --> 01:28:30,924
Yeah, we'll

2384
01:28:30,924 --> 01:28:32,544
share this document in

2385
01:28:32,544 --> 01:28:34,104
that room and we'll just have a little

2386
01:28:34,104 --> 01:28:34,584
discussion.

2387
01:28:34,584 --> 01:28:35,544
These are

2388
01:28:35,544 --> 01:28:36,084
Tony Fast (he/they): your prompts.

2389
01:28:36,084 --> 01:28:36,294
Feel

2390
01:28:36,294 --> 01:28:38,278
free to jump in with anything else

2391
01:28:38,278 --> 01:28:38,844
and let's

2392
01:28:38,844 --> 01:28:39,804
just start that session now.
Text: breakout discussions are not recorded

2393
01:28:47,334 --> 01:28:47,754
Tony Fast (he/they): All right.

2394
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:49,884
Well, we'll have

2395
01:28:49,884 --> 01:28:50,754
to do the summarization

2396
01:28:50,754 --> 01:28:53,844
part because we're
all in the same room and thank you all

2397
01:28:53,844 --> 01:28:56,514
for participating and bringing your

2398
01:28:56,514 --> 01:29:00,014
experiences to the discussion.

2399
01:29:00,014 --> 01:29:01,764
We have

2400
01:29:01,764 --> 01:29:01,854
a

2401
01:29:01,854 --> 01:29:02,499
feedback form,

2402
01:29:02,499 --> 01:29:03,144
we'll drop

2403
01:29:03,144 --> 01:29:04,224
a link in the chat.

2404
01:29:04,254 --> 01:29:05,304
We'd really love some

2405
01:29:05,304 --> 01:29:05,994
feedback.

2406
01:29:05,994 --> 01:29:06,684
There's

2407
01:29:06,684 --> 01:29:09,354
a new platform for us and where we

2408
01:29:09,354 --> 01:29:10,704
have three more of these events

2409
01:29:10,704 --> 01:29:12,054
scheduled through

2410
01:29:12,054 --> 01:29:12,744
March.

2411
01:29:12,984 --> 01:29:15,294
So we want to continue to
improve the experience for

2412
01:29:15,294 --> 01:29:15,789
everybody.

2413
01:29:15,789 --> 01:29:17,274
So please fill

2414
01:29:17,274 --> 01:29:17,484
out the

2415
01:29:17,484 --> 01:29:19,329
feedback survey.

2416
01:29:19,329 --> 01:29:21,174
What's after

2417
01:29:21,174 --> 01:29:21,504
Tony Fast (he/they): that one.

2418
01:29:24,034 --> 01:29:24,394
I love

2419
01:29:24,394 --> 01:29:25,579
these slides.

2420
01:29:25,579 --> 01:29:26,172
Yup.

2421
01:29:26,172 --> 01:29:26,764
So

2422
01:29:26,764 --> 01:29:29,734
next weekend, we're
going to be writing some more image

2423
01:29:29,734 --> 01:29:31,624
descriptions for docentation.

2424
01:29:31,624 --> 01:29:33,424
Tony Fast (he/they): We're going to
be running some low code exercises.

2425
01:29:33,694 --> 01:29:35,974
We'll have some experts around
thinking about some harder

2426
01:29:35,974 --> 01:29:39,094
problems in the technology

2427
01:29:39,094 --> 01:29:39,574
stack for

2428
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:40,002
Jupyter.

2429
01:29:40,002 --> 01:29:41,284
So the next

2430
01:29:41,284 --> 01:29:44,164
week is largely going
to be a breakout room, more of a working

2431
01:29:44,164 --> 01:29:44,784
session.

2432
01:29:44,784 --> 01:29:46,024
And then

2433
01:29:46,024 --> 01:29:48,814
in March, we're going to have another 
pair of events.

2434
01:29:48,994 --> 01:29:50,254
We'll have another featured

2435
01:29:50,254 --> 01:29:50,942
speaker.

2436
01:29:50,942 --> 01:29:53,004
We haven't,

2437
01:29:53,004 --> 01:29:54,564
I haven't heard anything about that yet.

2438
01:29:54,774 --> 01:29:56,874
We have another future speaker
and then we'll have another set

2439
01:29:56,904 --> 01:29:58,494
of breakout rooms and workshops

2440
01:29:58,524 --> 01:29:59,157
again.

2441
01:29:59,157 --> 01:30:02,954
So in the meantime we have

2442
01:30:03,004 --> 01:30:04,404
Jupyter accessibility

2443
01:30:04,404 --> 01:30:05,198
meetings.

2444
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:06,784
every other Wednesday

2445
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:08,724
you can find them on the Jupyter community

2446
01:30:08,724 --> 01:30:09,264
calendar.

2447
01:30:09,264 --> 01:30:10,344
So that's

2448
01:30:10,344 --> 01:30:11,784
another place for us to stay

2449
01:30:11,784 --> 01:30:12,204
involved.

2450
01:30:12,204 --> 01:30:13,464
If you want

2451
01:30:13,464 --> 01:30:15,594
Tony Fast (he/they): to learn more
about what the community's doing, if you

2452
01:30:15,594 --> 01:30:17,574
want to possibly probably see some data

2453
01:30:17,574 --> 01:30:19,314
visualizations we've got

2454
01:30:19,314 --> 01:30:20,124
the Jupyter monthly

2455
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:21,834
community call which is

2456
01:30:21,834 --> 01:30:22,824
happening, I believe in

2457
01:30:22,824 --> 01:30:24,009
two weeks.

2458
01:30:24,009 --> 01:30:25,194
Our accessibility

2459
01:30:25,194 --> 01:30:26,474
work happens on the Jupyter

2460
01:30:26,474 --> 01:30:30,321
Discourse and the Jupyter
accessibility repository.

2461
01:30:30,321 --> 01:30:32,244
And please join

2462
01:30:32,244 --> 01:30:34,714
us at a Jupyter Lab, bi-weekly Jupyter

2463
01:30:34,734 --> 01:30:36,474
lab, accessibility meeting sometimes

2464
01:30:36,574 --> 01:30:37,883
some time.

2465
01:30:37,883 --> 01:30:41,154
Yeah, so that's the ongoing

2466
01:30:41,154 --> 01:30:42,804
community stuff and things you can act on.

2467
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:43,644
We'd love to see some of your

2468
01:30:43,644 --> 01:30:44,784
faces again.

2469
01:30:44,784 --> 01:30:45,924
Is there

2470
01:30:45,924 --> 01:30:46,464
another site.

2471
01:30:54,464 --> 01:30:55,184
And thank you.

2472
01:30:56,744 --> 01:30:59,534
Thank you to me, Tony.

2473
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:03,404
Now, thank you to Isabela and
Tania for doing all of the

2474
01:31:03,404 --> 01:31:03,904
legwork.

2475
01:31:03,904 --> 01:31:04,904
This was

2476
01:31:04,904 --> 01:31:05,924
a long event to get

2477
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:06,974
together.

2478
01:31:06,974 --> 01:31:08,024
We,

2479
01:31:08,024 --> 01:31:09,434
Tony Fast (he/they): thought there
were a lot of important features

2480
01:31:09,434 --> 01:31:10,604
that we needed to have with it.

2481
01:31:10,814 --> 01:31:11,504
So thank God.

2482
01:31:11,564 --> 01:31:12,224
Thank goodness.

2483
01:31:12,224 --> 01:31:12,374
They're

2484
01:31:12,374 --> 01:31:13,214
happening now.

2485
01:31:13,214 --> 01:31:14,054
We have

2486
01:31:14,054 --> 01:31:16,004
to thank Bloomberg and AWS

2487
01:31:16,004 --> 01:31:17,864
and NumFocus for

2488
01:31:17,864 --> 01:31:18,614
the support on

2489
01:31:18,614 --> 01:31:19,394
these events.

2490
01:31:19,394 --> 01:31:20,174
We have

2491
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:21,614
to thank the Jupyter community building

2492
01:31:21,614 --> 01:31:27,786
team Ana and Christine,
,our sponsors which with

2493
01:31:27,786 --> 01:31:30,872
Bloomberg, NumFocus, AWS.

2494
01:31:30,872 --> 01:31:32,414
And thanks

2495
01:31:32,414 --> 01:31:34,424
to the team that wrote the event

2496
01:31:34,424 --> 01:31:34,844
proposal.

2497
01:31:34,844 --> 01:31:35,684
This was

2498
01:31:35,684 --> 01:31:39,284
Actually originally
going to be run by some, by some folks

2499
01:31:39,344 --> 01:31:41,234
and it was accepted before the pandemic.

2500
01:31:41,504 --> 01:31:42,794
So some of the delay in getting

2501
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:45,063
here was re-

2502
01:31:45,063 --> 01:31:45,819
thinking

2503
01:31:45,819 --> 01:31:47,589
about the workshop
differently so that we could do it

2504
01:31:47,589 --> 01:31:48,489
digitally.

2505
01:31:48,489 --> 01:31:50,289
And last

2506
01:31:50,289 --> 01:31:51,099
Tony Fast (he/they): but not least, thanks

2507
01:31:51,099 --> 01:31:53,319
to Frank, for

2508
01:31:53,319 --> 01:31:53,619
being

2509
01:31:53,619 --> 01:31:55,209
here and good luck

2510
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:56,319
with your PhD, man.

2511
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:57,549
You're doing really great work.

2512
01:31:57,549 --> 01:31:59,709
It's exciting to read
your future research.
