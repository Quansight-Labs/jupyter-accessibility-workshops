# Notes: How to build inclusive data representations with Frank Elavsky

This is a collaborative note-taking document for the first Jupyter accessibility workshop on January 15, 2022. 

## Notes by section

### Intro talks

No notes were taken during the intro talks.

### Main speaker: Frank Elavsky

Discussion question: How can we make open-source data work more accessible?

Summarized responses:
- Establish channels for feedback from folks with disabilities
- Have good documentation on making things accessible
- Ensure existing visualizations are accessible (as a good example and expectation)
- Make sure the tools that we use to do data work are accessible
- Figure out how to enable sonification
- Educate the broader community on accessibility
- More training on how to make data work accessible
- Include accessibility best practices in tutorial instructions - teach people the right way from day one
- Have people with disabilities as a part of the team building the tools and use your own projects in the development process
- Create a system of questions or considerations to iterate through during development.
- Make accessibility part of review process- part of the cultural expectation
- Improve command line/terminal interfaces to be accessible to those using screen readers
- Have regular “no mouse days” (days where people choose not to use a mouse navigating on a computer)

### Breakout sessions

The session is 20 minutes long.

Discussion prompts are
- How would you have done your past work differently if you already knew what you learned today?
- What new questions do you have? What more do you want to learn?

#### Breakout session group 1 notes
- Designing for accessibility having a perception as being a “plus” not a required, - best practice thing. How do you get good at advocating?
- Potential analog between internationalization efforts in JupyterLab and accessibility
- Figuring out how to set up systems is crucial. Individual level caring is not sustainable.
- Defining dog-fooding from earlier. The people working on the project get their needs met quickly and often. How do we make this happen for other people when the spaces don’t invite these other people?
- Recommendation of “design with accessibility in the mind from the start” being an issue because the tool already exists. Retrofitting is a different and substantial problem.
- Designers as an ideal moderator between forces building a tool because this is ultimately user experience and they are explicitly in charge of considering and including users.
- Past work you would’ve done differently
    - Being more intentional about what you put in an image
    - Being more intentional about when you use images and how you label them
    - Accessibility isn’t just color contrast, being more aware of a holistic experience
    - Made sure that this supports data literacy. We have so much data and people not only can’t access it but sometimes don’t have means to understand it.
    - Know this can’t be and isn’t neutral. A data experience is going to be told from a perspective. The data is going to be shaped by how it’s gathered. 
    - Don’t rely on color to solve problems. Starting without color can help with this.
    - Have accessibility work be done by the people who do the rest of the work. You are the best person to make your own work accessible, not an external accessibility force. You have the best understanding of the work and what it needs.
    - Listen to users. Prioritize finding their opinions and acting on them instead of coming up with things in isolation.
