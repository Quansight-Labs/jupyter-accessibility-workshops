### Breakout sessions

The sessions are just over 30 minutes long. There will be a break in the middle, then we will regroup after the second round.

There are two breakout session groups, each with a different topic:
1. contributing image descriptions
2. automated testing for themes

#### Breakout session group 1 notes (contributing image descriptions)

- This is [our working PR for the Jupyter documentation](https://github.com/isabela-pf/jupyter/pull/1)
- The [event agenda](mentored_sprint_agenda.md) has more details on how to participate

Topics discussed
- [Long descriptions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/#long-descriptions)
- When images should be removed and replaced with text (for example, screen shots of text)
- Describing images where the text form may already exist, but only as an external link
- [`aria-labelledby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby)
- Logos: describe them depending on context. Many are functional and need a description of what clicking the logo will do. ([logo alt text example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/#image-used-alone-as-a-linked-logo))
- Don't stop yourself from writing by aiming for perfection. Try your best, collaborate, and iterate.
