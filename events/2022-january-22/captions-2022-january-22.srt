1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Tony Fast (he/they): That's fun.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,160
Oh man.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,120
I was just about to tell you about my
recent accessibility, recent accessibility

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,070
problem that I had myself, my wife,
she got a delicious box of macaroons.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,490
See, they came in a lot of colors.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,070
Now I keep calling this again.

7
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:24,495
Because I have to look at the color
sheet and guess which color is which and

8
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:26,925
what flavor it is, but I'm colorblind.

9
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:30,675
So I think I keep accidentally
eating the ones that my wife wants

10
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:34,755
to eat, just because I don't know
what colors are, but it's a fun game.

11
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:35,325
Nonetheless.

12
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:39,285
I wish there were some more tech, if
they have more sprinkles on them, I'd be

13
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:40,905
able to tell something a little bit more.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,390
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Right.

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,670
Or I wonder if there's something
they could learn from like, right.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,820
Don't some pies do like,  they have
like different dough shapes on top too?

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,070
Like there's different things like that.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,090
I wonder how that would work with
that pastry, but yeah, that's a,

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,470
that's a really good,  example
of an inaccessible experience.

20
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:04,965
Tony Fast (he/they): You know, if I was
allergic to any of the things, it would be

21
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:09,045
really living life on the edge situation.

22
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:13,185
Oh my God.

23
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:14,235
It's the second event.

24
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:15,195
Oh, how cool.

25
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:16,695
I can't believe we got here.

26
00:01:18,104 --> 00:01:19,185
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
Yeah, but we did.

27
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:20,445
And it's exciting.

28
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:21,465
I'm excited at least.

29
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:22,215
Tony Fast (he/they): Yeah.

30
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,365
We'll get started in what, like
another minute or two,  let folks

31
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:27,845
roll in on their sleepy Saturday.

32
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,869
Yeah, it looks like we got a big
crew already eight folks, and to

33
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:38,470
all the west coast people, God
bless you for being up so early.

34
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,910
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): I
always wonder what I'm never quite

35
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,639
sure what the threshold for early is.

36
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,350
Like, I feel like I know the extremes.

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,289
If someone said to me 4:00 AM,
I would be like, that's early.

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,619
And if someone's at noon, I would
be like, that's probably not

39
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:57,445
early anymore, because it's
not technically morning, but in

40
00:01:57,445 --> 00:01:59,035
between that, I'm not really sure

41
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:03,955
Tony Fast (he/they): Why don't we
celebrate people like making it till noon?

42
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:09,145
Like nobody's never like making it
the lunch break, you know, I think

43
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:12,505
we just need to start celebrating
smaller wins as we go along.

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,970
Well, cool.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,870
What do you say

46
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,280
We kick off that presentation
and we get,  folks working

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,190
together and impacting open source?

48
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,630
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
Sounds good.

49
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,990
Do you want to introduce yourself
quickly first though, right.

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,490
Tony Fast (he/they): Oh, I don't
know how to do my own alt texts.

51
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,160
Hi, I'm Tony fast.

52
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,990
Isabela will

53
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,370
insert my alt text later on.

54
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,330
But  welcome to
the accessibility matters.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,940
I'll moderate, but this is Isabela's deal.

56
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,890
So I'm going to let her
go and do the intro.

57
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:48,674
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Yes.

58
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:51,375
That was a good one.

59
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,385
I'm Isabela Presedo-Floyd.

60
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,394
My pronouns are she/her.

61
00:02:55,725 --> 00:03:01,005
And in terms of my alt text, or
what I look like, I'm a Latina woman

62
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:05,204
who's wearing all kinds of pink
and orange stripes today and has

63
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:08,234
untamable black curly hair.

64
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:12,855
Tony also has untamable hair
except it's blonde and really cool,

65
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:15,015
like kind of a mohawk sometimes.

66
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,245
And yeah.

67
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,790
Tony Fast (he/they): I love
that you think it's blonde.

68
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,890
It's different colors and it is
anything else, but we'll go with it.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,149
I think I'm going to one day, I
want my alt texts to include silver fox.

70
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:37,215
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Oh,
no, that deserves a sip of tea.

71
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:37,725
Okay.

72
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:42,645
Well, welcome to our
second workshop today.

73
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:46,695
We're going to be talking about
writing image descriptions for

74
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:51,405
documentation also, depending on
interest automated tests for ensuring

75
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:55,395
that things like image descriptions,
which are very easy to test, are like

76
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:57,645
checked for when people are making PR.

77
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:02,635
And we're going to be taking action
today and helping you contribute to

78
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:04,375
Jupyter projects to help this out.

79
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:08,484
So let's get started if
this will work, please.

80
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:08,964
Okay.

81
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:09,475
There we go.

82
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:11,214
Tony Fast (he/they): It's
definitely going to work.

83
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:12,924
We've run this event many times.

84
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:14,424
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
I have keyboard problems.

85
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:15,295
That's the problem.

86
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:15,655
Go on.

87
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:22,905
So should we add this presentation to the

88
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:28,229
stream is that what we should
do if you want to, I'll give

89
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,179
people reminders real quick.

90
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,780
So first by attending this event, you are
agreeing to follow the code of conduct.

91
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,380
You definitely clicked a box if
you made it this far on the ticket

92
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,940
list, but that's just your reminder.

93
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:41,609
And also this event will be recorded.

94
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,810
It's already being reported and posted
publicly, at least the main session parts.

95
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
We won't be doing the breakout rooms.

96
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:48,900
So that's just.

97
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,630
And yeah.

98
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,990
Tony, why don't you welcome people
to your favorite planet in the solar system?

99
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,330
Tony Fast (he/they): Oh my God.

100
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,370
Welcome to planet Jupyter.

101
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,220
We're so happy to have
you orbiting it today.

102
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,570
So oh man, we didn't set
up our polls today, but we should

103
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,280
definitely get a poll going about
how new folks are to,  Jupyter.

104
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,900
But yes, welcome to, 
the world's most favorite

105
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,430
interactive computing environment.

106
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:25,015
A lot of us have been able to
benefit, oh my God, this is Dirty.

107
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:26,965
This is my, this is my puppy.

108
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,145
If you don't, if you take
away anything from this event,

109
00:05:30,174 --> 00:05:32,755
learn that having puppies in your
presentations makes them better.

110
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:35,935
If you're a cat person,
cats and dogs, that's fine.

111
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:40,465
But,  Jupyter is a place
for humans to interactive compute,

112
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:42,294
Dirty is not too great at the keys.

113
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:47,484
But right now, 
any,  disabled humans.

114
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:50,595
Might be kept away from
working on Jupyter.

115
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:53,715
So that's why we're all here to
help improve that experience.

116
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:56,595
You'll find tons of people in
different domains, in different

117
00:05:56,595 --> 00:06:01,395
disciplines using Jupyter, and we're
all here to make sure that everybody can

118
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,525
benefit the way that others have so far.

119
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:05,415
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Yeah.

120
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:10,635
And definitely to add to that, Jupyter
has a lot of different projects if

121
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:14,955
you're not familiar for not just a
file type interface or, you know,

122
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,025
even single community sometimes.

123
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,050
It's a pretty big place.

124
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,980
If you're new here.

125
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,460
Welcome.

126
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,130
Tony Fast (he/they): And if you're an,
if you start hearing words and brands

127
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,720
and things, that sound like band names,
and you're not sure what it is, feel

128
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,140
free to drop a link in the chat and
we'll try and send you some links.

129
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,200
Jupyter does have
a pretty big universe.

130
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,860
Accessibility's a small
but impactful part of it.

131
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,040
So we'd like to make sure that you
all find your place in the Jupyter.

132
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,150
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
And just to continue defining

133
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,100
what it is, what is accessibility?

134
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,540
Accessibility is making sure that we
are building things that can be used

135
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,000
by a full range of human experiences.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,680
So what that means in practice is
making sure that we put the needs

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,510
of people with disabilities first.

138
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,720
Right?

139
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,480
Cause those are the people that usually
aren't a part of these processes.

140
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:10,380
And are, you know, kept away from
being able to do the things that

141
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,190
they need to do and really should
be able to do like the rest of us.

142
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,900
So this could be anything like this could
be a really wide ranging thing today.

143
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,260
We're actually going to be talking
about web accessibility, probably

144
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,270
bringing up WCAG or the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines at some point,

145
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,590
which are the guidelines that
help us have a common language and

146
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,549
make decisions about what needs to be
done to get started with this kind of work.

147
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:39,045
Also accessibility is for everyone.

148
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:43,965
I talked a little bit at the last
workshop about curb cuts, which are

149
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,905
in like the curb for a sidewalk.

150
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:48,345
It's that ramp that you have.

151
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:51,915
So we had a little discussion
about what curb cuts are for

152
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:53,205
that I have summarized for you.

153
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:57,345
So they were made initially right,
for wheelchair users, but you can

154
00:07:57,345 --> 00:08:00,525
also use them if you're using a cart
or moving things for any reason.

155
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:04,885
Or you have a baby buggy, you
need to drive around. Skateboards

156
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:07,015
bikes, all kinds of cool things.

157
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:10,555
Tony was talking about doing
cool tricks on curb cuts before.

158
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:11,784
So, right.

159
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:15,655
Even though this is something that
was made specifically for disabled

160
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,755
people, this really does serve everyone.

161
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:20,395
And it serves a lot of the
times in unexpected ways.

162
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:22,075
So this is often used as a metaphor.

163
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:25,455
For all kinds of
accessibility efforts, right.

164
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:29,325
That if you center it around needs
of disabled people, that doesn't mean

165
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:32,475
you're only designing it for them,
that it's actually going to benefit

166
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:33,794
more than you probably anticipated.

167
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,965
Accessibility is also cross project.

168
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:40,325
This is really important in Jupyter
because there's a lot of things

169
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:42,485
under the Jupyter umbrella, right?

170
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:46,085
The Jupyter ecosystem has a lot
of different subprojects, and

171
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:50,045
this is not a single problem of
just one project versus the other.

172
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:54,215
This also means we need to be considering
things all the way from the notebook

173
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:58,295
file to the many different interfaces
to documentation and more, and of

174
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:02,225
course, documentation is what we'll be
working on today, but more on that more.

175
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:05,775
Because accessibility
is happening now, right?

176
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,255
We have these events, but they are
not the only accessibility efforts.

177
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:12,915
We have ongoing some
highlights from the last year.

178
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:13,844
We've also right,

179
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,594
we've had regular meetings around this for
a year, which has been great for bringing

180
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:21,584
in new people for collecting people across
projects that have an interest in this

181
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:22,905
and getting them a chance to community.

182
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,770
This has also grown our community.

183
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,770
So that means we've had totally
new people that I haven't met in

184
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,690
Jupyter spaces before come in.

185
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,300
We've had people get involved in projects.

186
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,160
They haven't before we've had some
audits of multiple projects based on.

187
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,170
That I mentioned earlier
with related issues and PRS.

188
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,230
So we can keep track of this work and
have a better sense of what needs to

189
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,740
be done and not just this nebulous,
it's an accessible kind of statement.

190
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,910
And we have CZI Essential Open
Source Software for Science.

191
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,100
We have a grant to further, Jupyter's
accessibility in the next two years,

192
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,230
which is really exciting to be able to.

193
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,829
You know, devoted funding for that.

194
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,610
So we're not just relying on volunteers
because as great as they are, and the

195
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,709
amazing work that they've done, this
is a really big project. And some goals

196
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,339
that we have going forward that we
haven't done yet adding automated tests.

197
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:17,170
This is really important for open source.

198
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,189
So we can't guarantee who is going to
review any contribution at any given moment.

199
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:25,785
We need to make sure the notebook file
format is accessible as can be right?s

200
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:28,365
There's a lot of projects here,
but pretty much all of them

201
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:29,745
interact with the notebook file.

202
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:33,015
And so do a lot of external,
like non-Jupyter projects.

203
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:35,445
So that foundational level is critical.

204
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:40,755
We'll also be updating, improving
documentation, and maybe I lied a

205
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,495
little, these aren't just future goals.

206
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:44,655
Two of these are today's goals, right?

207
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:47,685
Updating, improving documentation
and getting you involved.

208
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:48,900
Woo.

209
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,670
Get excited for that.

210
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,110
Tony Fast (he/they): You're so sneaky.

211
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,670
So sneaky last week you use the same
slide and you're like, oh, we're not

212
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,329
going to do nothing today, but sit down
this week, you're gonna and make us work.

213
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,970
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her):
I try for continuity.

214
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,329
If we have any people who have
been to both events, I have fun.

215
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,420
Yeah.

216
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,390
Going to segue a little bit.

217
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,230
That is right.

218
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,810
Documentation has images, almost always.

219
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,100
That's been my experience, definitely
many of the Jupyter docs do, but what

220
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,900
happens if you can't access them?

221
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,710
Whether that's because you can't see
them, the link, you know, you have a bad

222
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,510
internet connection and it doesn't load.

223
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,560
It's a broken link.

224
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,420
You're going to get something like this.

225
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,080
You're going to get some kind of icon
that like says there's no image and

226
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,340
you'll probably get a description

227
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,270
that's the file name.

228
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,680
Like image dot PNG.

229
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:38,865
Man.

230
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,824
I wish I knew it image.

231
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:40,605
That was, huh.

232
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,735
That's not a helpful description at all.

233
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:49,035
So this is actually one of the most
common WCAG failures that we've listed.

234
00:11:49,035 --> 00:11:53,175
This is,  by the WebAIM Million,
which is a project that takes the

235
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:55,515
top million webpages on the internet.

236
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:55,814
And

237
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:58,855
accessibility analysis over them.

238
00:11:59,064 --> 00:12:03,025
So missing alternative text for images
is actually the second, most common

239
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:05,365
failure for multiple years in a row.

240
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:08,845
So as simple as this seems, it's
actually a really big problem.

241
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:09,595
Okay.

242
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,910
This is something we're not catching.

243
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,240
Right?

244
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,420
Right.

245
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,750
Now I know we have Jupyter docs that
don't have this and then open source.

246
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,910
This might be how
automated tests could help.

247
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,150
So this is kind of the why for
what we're doing today, right?

248
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,050
This is the problem.

249
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:24,900
And we have kind of these potential
solutions to make sure our

250
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,729
community has a commitment to do
better, but backing up, backing up.

251
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,250
I said all these words, and I
didn't really tell you what an image

252
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,170
description is in the first place.

253
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,530
Right?

254
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,969
So here we have an image.

255
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,219
And if it's not there, it's going to
say, this is the planet Jupyter, right?

256
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,360
Tony Fast (he/they): You
spelled Jupyter wrong.

257
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,949
This always, I just want to find
the results that I need.

258
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,050
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Yeah.

259
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,760
That's, that's kind of a running joke.

260
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,300
We have, you know, selling Jupyter
becomes a real problem when you're

261
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,620
in this community for too long.

262
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,050
No matter how I spelled
Jupyter, it looks wrong to me.

263
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,240
Yeah.

264
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,219
But with this, right?

265
00:13:02,219 --> 00:13:03,959
There's so many types of images.

266
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:07,020
And similarly, there's a lot of
different types of alt texts.

267
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,219
So running through that really
quickly, there's a few major types

268
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:12,209
we're going to talk about today.

269
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:17,010
That there's more, and this is from
the W3C's tutorial about this.

270
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:19,290
so I can link that later.

271
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,979
If you want more information.
One type is an informative image.

272
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,859
So say I'm reading a blog
post and it says, puppies know

273
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:26,969
how to make emotional appeal.

274
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,400
And then we have this picture of a dog.

275
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,260
It would make sense to say, right.

276
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,750
A fluffy puppy looking at
the camera with big eyes.

277
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:33,870
Okay.

278
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,360
How the puppy is looking, right,

279
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,870
that it's cute.

280
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,020
And has big eyes is relevant
to the rest of the content.

281
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,350
Right?

282
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,400
It makes sense.

283
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,210
It doesn't just make sense to say
a dog afterwards, so to speak.

284
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,880
It doesn't have the emphasis as the image.

285
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,850
Tony Fast (he/they): What about, what
about if I was to do something like "Dawww?"

286
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,650
Is that informative, or?

287
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,930
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): I'm
always really unsure, to be honest.

288
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,689
I don't know if you're making
a joke or asking me seriously.

289
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,520
Yeah.

290
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,689
I took it too seriously, but yeah,
I've actually seen discussion around

291
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:13,810
that where people are talking about,
you know, how much emotion and

292
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,670
personality is appropriate in alt text.

293
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,360
This is probably a larger discussion,
but when I would be happy to have,

294
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,610
once we get past the baseline,

295
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,290
We also have functional images.

296
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:25,740
So right.

297
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,190
Say this is a button here
with this trashcan on it.

298
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,510
You wouldn't call it though.

299
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,900
A trash can because what the
button actually does is to delete.

300
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,850
So this might also be the case for
logos on home pages of websites, that

301
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,430
kind of thing, where you're trying
to describe what happens when you

302
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,600
interact with that image, because many
images are used in that kind of way.

303
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:48,105
There's also complex.

304
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:52,935
This is from the Jupyter docs
actually, and it's way too small for

305
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,765
you to see easily on these slides.

306
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:58,064
I don't have a single good
alt text recommendation for

307
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,295
this that would fit neatly.

308
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:02,925
So there's kind of a few guidelines
I use for complex images though,

309
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:03,255
right?

310
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,535
You go from general to specific, right?

311
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:09,375
You want to kind of give people a
sense of any titles, any layout.

312
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,540
Before going into the smaller details and
describe any key information or trends.

313
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,950
That's something that comes up a lot

314
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,000
if you're working with graphs. You also
want to make sure if there's any text in

315
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,840
the image, as there's a lot here, it needs
to be outside of the image somewhere.

316
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,180
There's a few options for
how you can do that, right.

317
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,830
It could just be in the
rest of the content.

318
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,540
It could be actually linked somewhere.

319
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,940
And what I mean by you may want to
link out is that alt text is not

320
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,760
intended to be too long, right?

321
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,010
So you may want to link to an external
kind of record of that, whether that's,

322
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,250
you know, a paragraph later on the
same page, or if you have a lot of

323
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,150
complex images, maybe you have some
kind of footnote system, but this

324
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,670
would be a lot to read through at once.

325
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,870
If you're just trying to go through them.

326
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,075
The final type I want to talk
about today is decorative images.

327
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:03,735
So once again, we're back on that
blog post about the dogs and I, the

328
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:07,725
post now says my mother will be happy
to know her dog is in my slides.

329
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:09,345
And then we just keep talking, right?

330
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,375
The heart here, doesn't
really add content.

331
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,545
It's just kind of there.

332
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,915
And so what you're going to
do is leave the tag empty.

333
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:19,725
You do still need the tag
because that lets assistive

334
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,765
technology know that this isn't.

335
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,724
Is, you know, it gives it something
to do with this image instead of

336
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:29,744
jutt read the image name, but empty
all text is actually an option.

337
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:33,824
The thing that we don't want is to
have no text or to have alt texts.

338
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:36,464
That's just the image name, which
is how some things automated.

339
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,370
On text styling, just
a few quick pointers, too.

340
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,780
We do want to spell things correctly.

341
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,180
You can totally write this and
something with a spell check

342
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,500
and then copy and paste it in.

343
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,760
I definitely, there are words

344
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,829
I don't have confidence spelling myself.

345
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,510
We want to have punctuation just like
anything else that helps navigate

346
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,829
sentence, case capitalization as
exemplified here just means the start of

347
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:00,870
the sentences, capitalized and proper.

348
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,050
Now.

349
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:04,355
And we only have consistent
naming for repeated elements.

350
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:07,055
This can get really important
in documentation, right?

351
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:10,714
Where if you have like step-by-step
images, you don't want to call like

352
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:14,734
something, a menu and one image
and then called the same thing, 

353
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:17,105
like a pop-up and another image.

354
00:17:17,105 --> 00:17:17,345
Right.

355
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:19,925
That would be really confusing
if you can't see that they're

356
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,484
the same thing for some reason.

357
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:24,185
So that's something we'll
probably be dealing with today.

358
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,360
And this is something
you'll hear me say a lot.

359
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,860
It's all about context.

360
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,790
So whenever you're in doubt, a lot
of the time working in these spaces,

361
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,990
the alt text paths have not been as
clear as say when you're like writing,

362
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,450
you know, a recipe or a blog post.

363
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,040
And you're like, oh,
that's a picture of soup.

364
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,450
Oh, that's a picture of a dog.

365
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,670
But what really matters is
thinking about how this

366
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,879
fits in the whole.

367
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:50,500
So reading the paragraphs before
and after, what kind of image is

368
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,909
the author expecting you to get?

369
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:55,600
Or what kind of information is the author
expecting you to get from this image?

370
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,929
Making sure that if the image
doesn't render, you could break

371
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,280
the link and test it yourself.

372
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,040
Does the whole thing still makes
sense without it? Those are some

373
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,530
good tests which we'll get to
try out a little later today.

374
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:09,735
And just more to advocate for this.

375
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:12,525
We're talking about this in Jupyter,
but it's a good skill for every

376
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,835
planet everywhere you go on the web.

377
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:15,225
Right?

378
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,565
Alt text is not a Jupyter problem.

379
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,235
So even if you're new to
Jupyter, don't worry at all.

380
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,455
This is totally a skill
that you can use here.

381
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:26,475
You can take with you and start making
sure that this is less of a failure

382
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,395
for these future accessibility audits.

383
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:29,685
So, yeah.

384
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:33,720
I think, for me that's work time.

385
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,820
Unless we want to take questions first.

386
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,090
I, up to you, Tony, what do you think
is wise here? I talked for a while.

387
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,910
Tony Fast (he/they): Oh, I
think that you did so great.

388
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,480
Right?

389
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,420
And it is an interplanetary
problem, right?

390
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,490
Like the NumPy team is on Mars.

391
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:52,635
There's alt text on Mars.
Mars, and Jupyter covered.

392
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:52,995
Great.

393
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:57,794
So we've got eight people
and I think we've run this

394
00:18:57,794 --> 00:18:59,475
event with eight people before.

395
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:05,324
So I think we just go into one
big old breakout room and we all

396
00:19:05,355 --> 00:19:07,995
spend this Saturday together.

397
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,585
Learning about alt text and context.
Note: Sprint discussions are not recorded.

398
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:18,024
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Of
course, I'm going to say it once more.

399
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:19,764
The point of this is just to celebrate.

400
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:23,155
I really am impressed by the amount of
work that you all did today, and you

401
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:27,114
tackled some really difficult images
or you tackled some simple images,

402
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:30,235
but thought very critically about
them and about what their meaning was.

403
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,584
And should they be there at all?

404
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:36,114
I, it makes me so happy to hear
people having these conversations

405
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:37,135
because I really don't enough.

406
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:43,635
Yeah, if we can go. (singing) Will the
slides respond to my keyboard?

407
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:44,895
It's always a mystery.

408
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:47,205
Tony Fast (he/they): I
just found the,

409
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:52,005
I just found the answer to one of
Gabriel's questions, ARIA labeled,

410
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:58,275
by let you say that a paragraph,
or ARIA described by lets you

411
00:19:58,275 --> 00:19:59,805
say that a paragraph describes.

412
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,160
So, if we get add linking to this,
then we'd be able to do stuff like

413
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,640
that, where you could say, Hey,
this paragraph has an ID and now

414
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,650
the ARIA described by this ID.

415
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,780
Yeah, I saw that.

416
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,740
And then I gave up, well, I didn't, I was
like, I'll have to look at this later.

417
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,530
Cause I don't know how to add IDs in RST.

418
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,220
So, you know.

419
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,020
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Yeah.

420
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,810
That's what happens.

421
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,870
I've found a lot of this
workshop is like, what can we do?

422
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,149
You know, the suggestions in this
time and our knowledge of how this

423
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,960
system works has been kind of limited,
but yeah, it's definitely still

424
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,429
helpful to be thinking about it.

425
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:39,210
Like we started them.

426
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,590
One more thing I want to say
we do have a feedback survey, so

427
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,570
you can give us any information.

428
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,649
This is basically just so we know if
anything went wrong, if there's anything

429
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:53,159
you really like to be done differently,
because we do have two more of these

430
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,689
events you'll hear about in the moment.

431
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:59,445
This is just making sure that
we're creating events that

432
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:00,554
actually are helping you.

433
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:01,725
That is the point of this.

434
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,645
So it'd be great to have your feedback.

435
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:09,435
I believe it's five or six questions and
some, several of them are not required.

436
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,054
So totally up to you.

437
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,365
And I can link that in the chat after.

438
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:15,165
Other thing.

439
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:16,845
I just mentioned upcoming events.

440
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:22,155
We have two more, one more speaker and
one more sprint coming up in March 2022.

441
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:26,355
I haven't put the dates here
because I want to be quadruple sure

442
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,385
before putting that information
somewhere that could confuse you.

443
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,440
They are coming soon and we
do have some stuff scheduled.

444
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,180
I'm really excited about it.

445
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,950
As much as I keep my lips closed.

446
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,070
The one thing I will say
too, with the sprint, we are

447
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,810
still open with sprint ideas.

448
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,710
If there is anything that you are
really passionate about learning with

449
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,540
the accessability stuff, I am happy
to hear suggestions with that because

450
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,070
there's multiple things we can do.

451
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,130
And it's still far enough that
if you have something that you'd

452
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,560
really like to hear about, I would
rather be doing something home.

453
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:04,290
So, yeah, that is going to be exciting
to keep up to date with this too.

454
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,300
There will be another Jupyter blog post.

455
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,990
I'm not sure how I'll be found this, which
will then mean it is also on Twitter,

456
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,520
but beyond the Jupyter Discourse, 
those will be the main venues that

457
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,980
I would follow to keep up with this.

458
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,670
Can you think of any others, Tony, that
you think it will be advertised on?

459
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,420
Tony Fast (he/they): No,
but you can join the community call this week.

460
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,340
There'll probably be another
community call next month.

461
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,780
There's a bunch of community calls.

462
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:30,525
So we hope to see folks around.

463
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:30,825
Yeah.

464
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:31,635
Isabela Presedo-Floyd (she/her): Yeah.

465
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:34,875
That's this slide is, there are a
few ways you can get involved in the

466
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,185
meantime. The first is community calls.

467
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,115
That's what Tony mentioned.

468
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:41,295
It's basically a cross-project
show and tell once a month.

469
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:42,975
It's in the last Tuesday of every month.

470
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:46,485
So that does mean there is one
this Tuesday, you can find it on

471
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:47,865
the Jupyter community calendar.

472
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:50,295
We'll have it in your time
zone and with relevant links.

473
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,775
If you haven't been to one
before, I would recommend just

474
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:56,685
showing up, but you are also always
free to share anything you want.

475
00:22:57,975 --> 00:23:01,765
I would say Jupyter related, but I you're
even open if you're like, oh, I did this

476
00:23:01,765 --> 00:23:05,535
cool thing on one project and I thought
it might interest you all to happen here.

477
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:06,825
Like we're pretty open there.

478
00:23:06,825 --> 00:23:10,485
It's just about making sure that everybody
is celebrating and communicating.

479
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:14,235
If you want to get involved with
Jupyter accessibility efforts

480
00:23:14,235 --> 00:23:17,805
specifically, there is a topic on
the Jupyter discourse for this.

481
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:19,515
You can find what people
are already talking about.

482
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:24,375
And we have a Jupyter accessibility,
GitHub repo, which is kind of the

483
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,385
center for coordinating cross project.

484
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:29,085
That's why I point people there
first, because each project kind

485
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:30,615
of has its own things going on.

486
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:33,975
You can also join a JupyterLab, 
accessibility meeting.

487
00:23:33,975 --> 00:23:40,395
It is JupyterLab, but,  we have some,
for example, I'm always in that meeting.

488
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,615
And so I'm happy to
talk about other things.

489
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:46,815
It's mostly just JupyterLab because
that's the people that we had that had.

490
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,540
But we're totally open to discussing
accessibility on a wider scale there,

491
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,230
because most of the problems we
have per project are problems in all

492
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,940
projects and we should help each other.

493
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:02,130
And finally, I have some thank you is
because this has been a big process

494
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,570
running these events, Tony and Tania in
particular have helped me run this event.

495
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,830
I don't know what I would do without
Tania's tech support and just general.

496
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:17,925
event wrangling knowledge, as well as Tony has so
much experience with event coordinating.

497
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:21,825
And I really don't think this would have
been possible without either of them.

498
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:26,475
You also have the Jupyter community
building committee,  Ana and Christine

499
00:24:26,475 --> 00:24:31,004
were two of my points of contact for
this making sure that we had all the

500
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:33,435
Goa heads and funding for speakers.

501
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:38,010
The Jupyter community workshops
sponsors, or how we tie into that

502
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,209
community building committee.

503
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,350
So thank you to them.

504
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,790
NumFocus is also part of this
whole coordination, and I really

505
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,000
appreciate that too. They're,
similarly, part of the sponsors.

506
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,750
And we have a team that originally
about this wrote this event

507
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,610
proposal, because these events.

508
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,860
I have been a long time coming.

509
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,030
People have been wanting this.

510
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,510
A lot of people have really been trying
to push for Jupyter accessibility, and I

511
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:08,730
want to acknowledge that that effort came
before me and I'm grateful that they did

512
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,110
it and that we can have these events now.

513
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,050
So thank you! Anything
you'd like to add, Tony?

514s
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,960
Tony Fast (he/they): Thank you.

515
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:18,090
