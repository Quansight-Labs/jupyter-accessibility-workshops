### Main speaker: Eric Bailey

- [Talk resources](at bit.ly/a11y-project-jupyter)
- What is accessibility?
     - A civil right in many countries
     - Designing to ensure that things built can serve the needs of disabled people
     - Proactive versus reactive approaches (we’re going to spend more time on proactive)
- Tent poles to accessibility: Perceivable, operable, understandable, robust
     - Perceivable: example of contrast issues (sun at noon and low vision)
     - Operable: what happens if you can’t use a keyboard, a mouse?
     - Understandable: comprehending content (depression as impacting comprehension)
     - Robust
- Ways of understanding disability
     - Social versus medical models
     - We’re recontextualizing to focus on the social model (idea that it’s a mismatch between ability ranges and spaces we build)
- “Inclusive design is a new way of looking at an old idea”
     - Example of U.S. military practice of trying to find average height so people pilot planes better.
     - Building to the average height did not work!
     - Making the seats and straps and space adjustable allowed everyone to adjust to what they need and was far more successful.
- Inclusive design is universal design and intersectional 
- In practice
     - Create comparable experiences
          - Image description examples
     - Consider the situation
     - Be consistent
          - Underlined links example
     - Give control
          - Reader mode (need a different font, font size, color)
     - Offer choice
          - Bulk editing in emails (delete all selected)
     - Add value
- The honey and vinegar
     - Vinegar: access issues are a violation of a civil right and lawsuits can come with that
     - Honey: estimated $490 billion dollars disposable income in disabled working-age adults in the U.S.
     - Honey: Assistive tech drives development of all kinds of tech we have come to take for granted (like keyboards)
- Don’t use accessibility overlays ([Overlay fact sheet](https://overlayfactsheet.com/))
- Shift-left methodology
     - Have inclusive design considerations from the start
     - Who is and isn’t present in the room?
     - Feedback from the start
     - Test ideas early and often with people of diverse backgrounds
     - And keep testing after launch
- Survival bias
     - U.S. air force example of figuring out where planes were being shot down from
     - First attempt: putting armor where the bullet holes were found (didn’t increase return rates of planes)
     - Second attempt: realizing that they were working with the planes that came back. Putting armor where there were no bullet holes works
- Personas
     - In design, this is 
     - Critique of this is that there is no “omniperson”
     - List of things people have in common
- Limits of empathy
     - You can’t duplicate lived experiences.
     - An experience with trying to use a screen reader if you don’t use one every day is not the same as people who use them daily
- How to fix things (some ideas)
     - [Talk resources](at bit.ly/a11y-project-jupyter)
     - Write with plain language
     - Refine user experience with
          - information architecture that makes sense
          - use generous negative space
          - heading levels are meaningful and not skipped
          - interactive focus indicators
          - main content first
    - Refine typography
         - Fonts with multi-language support
         - Limit the number of fonts used
         - Adequate font size
         - Limit variant treatments
         - Don’t underline non-link content 
     - Color
     - Refine your forms
     - Refine your media
