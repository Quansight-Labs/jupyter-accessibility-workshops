# Forms related to the events

For now, these forms are not taking public responses to make sure we don't get information before we are ready. They all need to be made public pre-event.

## 1.1 Speaker event
- [Pre-event attendee sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0IgPYgf0di8eM6HP1qbqduPTeGEFadXZRSIDYEXlEOgA_bw/viewform?usp=sf_link). This may be better as a meetup event to collect the info as a group and advertise, but for now we have a form.
- [Post-event feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7oMTwfLZfntqh9p8Npfsd9-o4jhSaVjhMNuuVMen8RmG3Ow/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## 1.2 Sprint
