## Questions in search of answers
- Do we focus only on alt text, or descriptive content for other media as 
well? The JupyterLab docs have a lot of videos.
- Do we need resources for git and github, or is that out of scope for our 
attendees?
- Project Jupyter docs have less content and are a more manageable goal for 
the sprint. Do enough people use them for this to do a helpful task?
- What is a reasonable amount of time for a sprint? How long do we want this 
to be?
