# Mentored sprint agenda
This event is held one to two weeks following our accessibility learning 
experience.

## Sprint theme
Documentation and alt text

## Proposed projects
(not all of these, but a list to choose)
- [Project Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
and/or 
- [JupyterLab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
- [JupyterHub documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
- [Jupyter Notebook documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)

## Event agenda
- **:00-:10** Folks arrive
- **:10-:15** goal setting for event/what we plan to do
- **:15-:30** an icebreaker to introduce attendees to each other
- **:30-1:00** Learning time.  Present the basics around alt text, the projects, 
and how the sprint will work. Share resources for further reference in the event.
- **1:00- 1:05** Team up! Join a room to work on a (pre-determined) section of the docs. 
- **1:05- 1:45** Work time! There is also a place for review.
- **1:45- 2:00** Break time! Move around.
- **2:00- 2:45** Work time part 2! Remember to get review.
- **2:45- 3:00** Wrap up! Time for giving feedback and info on upcoming events.
- **3:00- 4:00 Optional** Celebrate! Nominate `alt text hall of fame` by category and vote. 
Top voted ones and their authors live in infamy on the repo. This time is also spillover 
for people still wanting to connect with others.

## Questions in search of answers
- Do we focus only on alt text, or descriptive content for other media as 
well? The JupyterLab docs have a lot of videos.
    - Past mini-events have gone well with a focus on images because there is already so much to learn there.
- Do we need resources for git and github, or is that out of scope for our 
attendees?
    - For the alt text workshops, minimal git is necessary. People just need an account beforehand.
- Project Jupyter docs have less content and are a more manageable goal for 
the sprint. Do enough people use them for this to do a helpful task?
    - Since this is a Jupyter-wide event, it would be awesome to start with adding to Project Jupyter resources. I don't know if there's enough images here, so we may want to supplement with other projects.
- What is a reasonable amount of time for a sprint? How long do we want this 
to be?
- Add community member speaking about other accessibility work needed in Jupyter?
