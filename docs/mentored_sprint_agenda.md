# Mentored sprint agenda
This event is held one to two weeks following our accessibility learning 
experience.

## Sprint theme
Documentation and alt text (media descriptions?)

## Proposed projects
- [Project Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
and/or 
- [JupyterLab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 

I'm open to other Jupyter documentation being proposed, but I'd like to keep 
a narrow scope per sprint so the community can leave feeling successful rather 
than like they made only a small dent in a pile of work. I am also aiming for 
a documentation-focused sprint like this to be reproducible, so we could 
sprint on other docs another time.

## Event agenda
- **:00-:10** Folks arrive
- **:10-:15** goal setting for event/what we plan to do
- **:15-:25** an icebreaker to introduce attendees to each other
- **:25-:55** Learning time.  Present the basics around alt text, the projects, 
and how the sprint will work. Share resources for further reference in the event.
- **:55-1:05** Team up! Choose a (pre-determined) section of the docs to tackle. 
Plan your team's approach.
- **1:05-3:00** Work time.
- **3:00-3:30** Get review. Pair up with another team and switch sections for 
review. Pool tough questions in a place for the larger group.
- **3:30â€“3:45** Celebrate! Nominate alt text hall of fame by category and vote. 
Top voted ones and their authors live in infamy on the repo.
- **3:45-4:00** Wrap up. Time for giving feedback and info on upcoming events.

## Questions in search on answers
- Do we focus only on alt text, or descriptive content for other media as 
well? The JupyterLab docs have a lot of videos.
- Do we need resources for git and github, or is that out of scope for our 
attendees?
- Project Jupyter docs have less content and are a more manageable goal for 
the sprint. Do enough people use them for this to do a helpful task?
- What is a reasonable amount of time for a sprint? How long do we want this 
to be?
