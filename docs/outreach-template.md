Hi {{name}},

I’m {{sender}}, and I’m reaching out on behalf of the Project Jupyter community. We’d like to invite you to join us as a {{["speaker", "attendee", "volunteer"]}} at our upcoming accessibility workshop on some Saturday this {{month}}.

We’ve been working on improving the inclusivity of Project Jupyter's widely regarded open source tools for data science and teaching. One of our main goals is to connect Jupyter experts with accessibility experts like yourself to build an open-source community that exemplifies what it means to have accessibility as a core priority.

The event is still being planned and we are prepared to book the event at your convenience. Speakers will be paid for their time. If you have a speaking fee please let us know, otherwise we will can work with you on compensation.

Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. If you are interested in joining us and can’t make that time, please let me know. We are planning multiple events and may be able to schedule one that works for you.

Best, {{sender}} and Project Jupyter
