Hi {{expert-name}},

I’m {{sender-name}}, and I’m reaching out on behalf of the Project Jupyter community. 
We’d like to invite you to join us as a {{speaker, participant, something else?}} at our 
upcoming accessibility {{event}}.

We’ve been working on making our various projects accessible and are running 
community-centered events to educate and gather efforts around accessibility 
work in these spaces. One of our main goals is to connect various Jupyter 
experts with accessibility experts like yourself to build an open-source 
community that exemplifies what it means to have accessibility as a core 
priority.

The event is planned for {{date}}, and also have a budget of {{money}} to 
offer you for your time.

Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. If you are interested 
in joining us and can’t make that time, please let me know. We are planning 
multiple events and may be able to schedule one that works for you.

Best,
{{sender-name}}
