Hi [name],

I’m [a differnt name], and I’m reaching out on behalf of the Project Jupyter community. 
We’d like to invite you to join us as a [speaker, participant, something else?] at our 
upcoming accessibility [event type or name].

We’ve been working on making our various projects accessible and are running 
community-centered events to educate and gather efforts around accessibility 
work in these spaces. One of our main goals is to connect various Jupyter 
experts with accessibility experts like yourself to [I've gone through so 
many options for this part and don't know what to do anymore].

The event is planned for [date], and also have a budget of [¿¿¿money???] to 
offer you for your time.

Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. If you are interested 
in joining us and can’t make that time please let me know. We are planning 
multiple events and may be able to schedule one that works for you.

Best,
[a different name]
